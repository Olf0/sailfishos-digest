# Repository roundup

The covered timespan is a bit longer than usual and even if it encompasses the end of the year holidays, the number of changes in the various Sailfish OS repositories is really large. Let's highlight some of the changes that will likely be part of the next release:
- many library updates, fixing CVEs, like in `libtiff` or `bluez5`,
- connectivity fixes in IPv6 networks with the work on CLAT in `connman`,
- a new "in-line" way to reply to notification (see changes in the repositories related to the user interface),
- immediate locking of the device when taping on the lock icon in the top menu,
- and for developpers, version upgrades of different base tools, libraries and compilers. If not yet merged in, definitely worked on are a GCC update to 10, a `glibc` update to 2.38, an LLVM update to 15, a `rust` update to 1.75 and `glib2` update to 2.78.

About version updates, this repository roundup is not mentioning enough the work of **flypig** (and many other contributors) on updating the browser to ESR91. Finally, a special mention also to **attah** who's contributed to a significant amount of package upgrades in the past weeks and months.

## Telephony stack

* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, **pvuorela**, while checking for a bug in Ofono / QOfono, commited some code changes [bringing more context on DBus errors](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/21).

## Communication services

* `bluez5`, the Linux Bluetooth stack, **mal** worked on [moving to version 5.76](https://github.com/sailfishos/bluez5/pull/11). This also fixes some recent CVE issues and replace an [earlier attempt](https://github.com/sailfishos/bluez5/pull/10) at fixing those.

## User interface

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** introduced a [new hint](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/47) to be able to store the priviledge level of notifications.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-notifications`, QML bindings to the Freedesktop notification system, **pvuorela** added [support for a hint called "resident"](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-notifications/pull/11), so notification is not automatically discarded when an action is done, but need to be explicitely removed by the user or the sender.

* `mce`, a framework exposing hardware status of display, buttonsâ€¦, **spiiroin** provided a patch to [use the kernel time to filter multipress of the power button](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/25), instead of an internal timer. This pull request also changes the display off command to use a bitmask instead of values, adding a mask asking to lock the device, see the [commit message](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/25/commits/cdf8e22441cd417689c2f2a90ce6bd6609f0d18e). As explain in [that commit](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/25/commits/bae525af8cb9b17f2acfb73a23db14c7af4e486e), this mask is now used by default, meaning that tapping the lock icon in the top menu will actually immediately lock the device and not just turn the screen off. It is possible to get back to the old behaviour with `mcetool --set-display-off-override=disabled`.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock`, QML bindings for device lock access, **spiiroin** ensured that the [manual locking is properly honoured](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock/pull/7) and don't start a timer.
