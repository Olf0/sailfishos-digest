# Repository roundup

The documentation website is becoming more and more complete, with descriptions for applications but also with more technical articles on logging and debugging. It has definitely become a source of valuable information from beginner usage to expert one. There has been a lot of activities in various libraries recently, with the initiative from **neochapay** to extend packaging to allow concurrent installation of Qt5 and Qt6 versions. This is not directly for a use in Sailfish OS, but these are notable contributions helping to prepare the transition.

## Telephony stack

* `libgofonoext`, a client library for Sailfish OS ofono extensions, **slava** [freshened up the copyright holder](https://github.com/sailfishos/libgofonoext/commit/0fe9559e7cc6efa1036e3954fd952129041c3bc7) and [updated the Debian packaging compatibility level](https://github.com/sailfishos/libgofonoext/commit/cd1e9d408ffcd0f07261459074082fa0848bebdf).

## Audio stack

* `ohm-plugins-misc`, some plugins inherited from Nokia for the open hardware manager (OHM), **jusa** [ensures that headphone connexion / disconnexion is properly reported](https://github.com/sailfishos/ohm-plugins-misc/pull/7) for drivers that inverts logic.

## Networking

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** merged in his pull request [not to timeout VPN that are waiting for credentials](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/34). **LaakkonenJussi** also backport an upstream patch [fixing a crash on malformed HTTP response](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/35). With the previous patch, errors became silently ignored, so **LaakkonenJussi** added a merge request [to actually log these](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/36).

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** is [exposing a new `association` state for VPNs](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/12). **elro34** found and [fixed a memory leak on DBus exposition of technology changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/13).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings for various system parameters, **LaakkonenJussi** [added an `association` state to the VPN status](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/32) when the VPN is waiting for credentials for instance.

## Low level libraries

* `libusb-moded-qt`, a library of Qt bindings for usb_moded, **neochapay** [adjusted the source and the build system for Qt6 compliance](https://github.com/sailfishos/libusb-moded-qt/pull/2).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-configuration`, QML bindings to access configuration values, **neochapay** is also proposing changes to [get the package build with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-configuration/pull/4).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-time`, QML bindings for time handling (system wide clocks…), **neochapay** continued his [upgrade work for Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-time/pull/3) with this package.

* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, **neochapay** also pushed a request for [Qt6 upgrade of the build system](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/14). **jmlich** spotted [an installation issue for the test and fixed it](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/15).

## SDK and documenation

* `doxygen`, the code documentation tools, **vigejolla** [updated to the latest 1.9.5 version](https://github.com/sailfishos/doxygen/pull/1) from last August (from 1.7.6.1) and rework the repository layout to use git submodules. He also [fixed a build dependency](https://github.com/sailfishos/doxygen/pull/2) in a second commit.

* `amber-web-authorization`, a QML module allowing applications to perform OAuth1 and OAuth2 requests, **vigejolla** [clarified the documentation on how to declare a build dependency on this package](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-web-authorization/pull/6), following a [question on the Forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/amber-web-authorization-not-available-in-qtcreator/13142).

## Software engineering

* `python-setuptools`, easily build and distribute Python packages, **mal** has [removed the build date from `egg-info` tag](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-setuptools/pull/1), to ensure reproducible builds.

* `gecko-camera`, a plugin-based library for Gecko to simplify video capture, **mal** has [removed the release tag from the versioning](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-camera/pull/10) to ensure reproducible builds.
