# Repository roundup

The number of updated low-level components (by **mal** and other sailors) has been important these last days. A new SDK version seems to be around the corner with various updates to the QML documentations and links for SDK QtCreator.

## Telephony stack

* `mobile-broadband-provider-info`, the database of access point configurations, **atlochowski** [removed Chess Communication and Ludo Mobil](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/18) since they are not MVNO on Telia network anymore.

## Audio stack

* `amber-mrpis`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **pvuorela** [fixed metadata tracking API](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/15). **flypig** proposes a large [fix on the loop status](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/16), correcting possible crashes.

## Networking

* `libgsupplicant`, a client library for wpa_supplicant, **slava** added bindings for [new cipher and key management algorithms](https://github.com/sailfishos/libgsupplicant/pull/4).

* `sofia-sip`, a SIP library, **mal** [updated it to 1.13.11](https://github.com/sailfishos/sofia-sip/pull/2).

## The browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **krnlyng** proposes to [simplify building](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/150) when the fix in scratchbox will be merged. **rainemak** partially reverted https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/148 to [reset default input field backgrounds to white](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/151). This last fix is also part of a `upgrade-4.5.0` branch to avoid a regression on input fields.

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **pvuorela** [updated the `import` statements](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/163) dropping the old `Meego.xxx` naming convention.

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser itself, **rainemak** [added tests for radio and checkboxes](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1010). Following https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/browser-says-about-blank-is-not-secure/9544, **rainemak** also [removed the secure indication](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1011) for the `about:xxx` pages.

## Synchronisation framework

* `qmf-notifications-plugin`, a plugin to send notifications on email changes, **dcaliste** raised a discussion on the [feedback definition that should be emitted when receiving emails](https://github.com/sailfishos/qmf-notifications-plugin/pull/2).

## Calendar stack

* `libical`, serialise and deserialise ICal file format, **pvuorela** [upgraded it to 3.0.16](https://github.com/sailfishos/libical/pull/2).

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** proposed to [add `thisAndFuture` attribute in the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/43). This would allow to support changes from a point in time for recurring events at UI level.

## Document reader

* `sailfish-office`, the document application, **pvuorela** updated it to use the [new `Nemo.xxx` QML imports](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-office/pull/192).

## Positioning

* `mlsdb-data`, a packaging of Mozilla databse used to assist GPS positioning, **dsuni** [changed the database format](https://github.com/sailfishos/mlsdb-data/pull/6).

## System control

* `sailfish-utilities`, the setting page to restart failing services, **vigejolla** moved the [descriptions of action to point to the forum](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-utilities/pull/63). **pvuorela** [migrated the QML imports](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-utilities/pull/64) to use newer `Nemo.xxx` formulations.

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** [reverted to numbers in charging limit macros](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/19) to avoid parsing issues when converting these macros to strings. **spiiroin** proposes to [supervise screen access on device in mce](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/20), to reduce blank screen time and avoid race conditions to hardware access.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [fixed the unit test on volume control](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/35). **pvuorela** also simplified what is exposed by [removing the QML bindings giving the connectivity status](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/36) (using Connman is better to do this than asking the compositor). **spiiroin** is working on [a link between mce and lipstick](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/37) so the latter can tell the former what it needs to become the compositor.

* `minui`, a library for minimal UI framebuffer applications, **spiiroin** proposes to [fix the return value of `gr_init()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/minui/pull/7) in case of drm backends that fails in `gr_flip()`.

* `profiled`, manages user settings, **dsuni** is working to [move the configuration files from \~/.profiled` to XDG config directory](https://github.com/sailfishos/profiled/pull/3).

* `timed`, time and alarm handling daemon, **dsuni** is working to [move the configuration files from \~/.timed` to XDG config directory](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/4).

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, **pvuorela** merged **attah**'s pull request [removing PDF tools from inside the jail](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/123) (not needed anymore). **flypig** [expanded the documentation for the sharing permission](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/129). **olf0** [rephrased the description of the `Compatibility` permission](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/130) to clarify its role.
