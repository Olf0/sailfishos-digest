# Repository roundup

Now that 4.5.0 has been published and will become available for everyone after the early access period, many repositories are updated with latest upstream versions, like the update of the C library that is worked on. Control of media playing from QML is also receiving a lot of attention with various pull requests fixing bugs in `mpris-amber`.

## Telephony stack

* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, **jmlich** [updated the test and example application since the modems are loaded asynchronously](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/17).

## Networking

* `libpcap`, provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring, **mal** [updated it to 1.10.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/libpcap/pull/1).

* `tcpdump`, a network traffic monitoring tool, **mal** [updated it to 4.99.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/tcpdump/pull/2).

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **pvuorela** [droped `NetworkManager::getTechnology()` from QML API](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/16) because ownership is not clear and to replace it with a simpler `hasTechnology(string)`.

## The browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **mal** [cleaned-up the build process with the upgrade of CLang](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/152).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** [added `thisAndFuture` attribute in the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/43). This would allow to support changes from a point in time for recurring events at UI level. **dcaliste** [fixed issues in the initial commit](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/45) with a second pull request.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **beroset** upgraded the code to [work with newer versions on Qt on AsteroidOS](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/42).

## System control

* `timed`, time and alarm handling daemon, **dsuni** [moved the configuration files from \~/.timed` to XDG config directory](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/4). **dsuni** also cleaned up the code [replacing deprecated expressions](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/5).

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** simplified what is exposed by [removing the QML bindings giving the connectivity status](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/36) (using Connman is better to do this than asking the compositor).

* `profiled`, manages user settings, **dsuni** [moved the configuration files from \~/.profiled` to XDG config directory](https://github.com/sailfishos/profiled/pull/3).

* `amber-mrpis`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **flypig** [fixed a scaling issue in duration](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/18): when the duration is provided to the metadata as milliseconds it must be scaled to microseconds for internal use. **flypig** is proposing to [let the application to choose the prefix for DBus paths](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/19). **flypig** is also proposing to [add `canShuffle` and `canLoop` properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/20).

## Low level libraries

* `libksba`, the "Kasbah" library for utilising X.509 certificates, **mal** [updated it to 1.6.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/libksba/pull/3).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager`, QML bindings for file management, **notkit** [replaced `euidaccess()` with `opendir()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager/pull/5) since the former is not taking ACL into account.

* `lxc`, Linux resource containers, **krnlyng** [updated it to 5.0.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/lxc/pull/5) from 4.0.10.

* `mce`, mode control entity, **nephros** opened a discussion on how to handle the assistant button present on Xperia 10iii phones. He proposed to [expose this button as a home button](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/21) from mce, but he also discussed many other possibilities.

* `minui`, a library for minimal UI framebuffer applications, **spiiroin** [fixed the return value of `gr_init()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/minui/pull/7) in case of drm backends that fails in `gr_flip()`.

* `yamui`, minimal UI tool for displaying simple graphical indicators, **spiiroin** proposed to [reimplement with a GLib-based main loop](https://github.com/sailfishos/yamui/pull/11). Like that, yamui can expose a compositor DBus service.

* `yamuisplash`, a simple splash screen for SailfishOS, **spiiroin** [propagated the changes in `yamui`](https://github.com/sailfishos/yamuisplash/pull/3).
