Repository activities from 2022-03-22 to 2022-03-31
---------------------------------------------------

### Positioning
* `mlsdb-data`, a packaging of Mozilla databse used to assist GPS positioning, [update of cell tower positions](https://github.com/sailfishos/mlsdb-data/pull/5) by A. Branson. Interestingly, he noticed a size reduction of the database (less tower are indexed) and discussed the possible reasons with sledges.

### Telephony stack
* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, neochapay added support to [call the Ofono GPRS context reset](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/6) on DBus. He also opened a new pull request to [add a "preferred" property to the connection context](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/7), usage is not specified at the moment.

### Calendar stack
* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, dcaliste submitted a pull request to [add low level support to change notebook](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/25) of events. Currently, updating notebook of a given event is disabled because it was then not possible in mKCal to get notified of the change, which is an issue for synced accounts.

### The web browser
* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, flypig is working on [implementing a stack of controllers](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/145), so having multiple WebViews in an app would be possible. He's also working on backporting some upstream patchs from Mozilla to [optimize relocation in compiled libraries](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/146) (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Elfhack).

### Camera and video
* `droidmedia`, a link to access hardware encoder / decoders from Android, d-grigorev continued his work to [add bitrate control](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/102) and on [multi-threading the media source](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/101), so some fetching inputs will not slow down the output (like the camera).

### SDK
* `sailfish-qtcreator`, Qt Creator provided with the SDK, two new pull requests by martyone, https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/531 and https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/530/commits

### Quality / software engineering
* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, Tomin submitted several pull requests to make the automatic tests run and success on the test farm, by [using the right environment and permissions](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/5) (accepted) and by [tweaking the tests for Sailfish usage](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/8) (under review).
* `qtwebkit5`, Qt bindings for Webkit web engine, a work in progress to [avoid packaging debug symbols](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtwebkit5/pull/1) and thus decrease package size. This may be of limited impact as mentioned flypig due to the deprecation of QtWebkit in SailfishOS.
* `transfer-engine`, the backend to allow sharing data between apps, attah submitted a request to [cleanup the naming scheme](https://github.com/sailfishos/transfer-engine/pull/9) in the examples to make them more clear to users.
* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS / phone history, laakkonenjussi proposed a fix to the [failing test matching contacts](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/5).
