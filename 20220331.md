Repository activities from 2022-03-22 to 2022-03-31
---------------------------------------------------

### Positioning
* `mlsdb-data`, a packaging of Mozilla databse used to assist GPS positioning, [update of cell tower positions](https://github.com/sailfishos/mlsdb-data/pull/5) by A. Branson. Interestingly, he noticed a size reduction of the database (less tower are indexed) and discussed the possible reasons with sledges.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to handle system parameters, a contribution from neochapay enabling the [proper detection of GPS capability](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/26) for systems not Android-based, but using `gpsd` instead.

### Telephony stack
* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, neochapay added support to [call the Ofono GPRS context reset](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/6) on DBus. He also opened a new pull request to [add a "preferred" property to the connection context](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/7), usage is not specified at the moment.

### Calendar stack
* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, dcaliste submitted a pull request to [add low level support to change notebook](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/25) of events. Currently, updating notebook of a given event is disabled because it was then not possible in mKCal to get notified of the change, which is an issue for synced accounts. Comments on pull request raised some potential issues with the approach and request is currently stalled.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, dcaliste fixed a regression he introduced during earlier work reorganising code in the bindings. This regression was introduced in a commit from early in March and [listed an empty organizer in every event](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/7).

### The web browser
* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, flypig is working on [implementing a stack of controllers](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/145), so having multiple WebViews in an app would be possible. He's also working on backporting some upstream patchs from Mozilla to [optimize relocation in compiled libraries](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/146) (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Elfhack).

### Camera and video
* `droidmedia`, a link to access hardware encoder / decoders from Android, d-grigorev continued his work to [add bitrate control](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/102) and on [multi-threading the media source](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/101), so some fetching inputs will not slow down the output (like the camera).

### SDK / documentation
* `sailfish-qtcreator`, Qt Creator provided with the SDK, two accepted pull requests by martyone, https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/531 and https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/530/commits
* `docs.sailfishos.org`, website sources, four new pull requests from rainemak [polishing details](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/53) on [how to enable log output](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/52) with the browser, but also about [testing performances](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/54) of [the browser](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/56). Also a contribution from pherjung to [correct a mistake in code sample from the Python tutorial](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/55).

### Hardware adaptation
* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, thaodan pushed a pull request [cleaning and fixing issues in the `mer-android-chroot` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/7).

### Quality / software engineering
* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, Tomin submitted several pull requests to make the automatic tests run and success on the test farm, by [using the right environment and permissions](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/5) (accepted) and by [tweaking the tests for Sailfish usage](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/8) (under review).
* `qtwebkit5`, Qt bindings for Webkit web engine, Flypig modified the packaging to [avoid debug symbols in final RPMs](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtwebkit5/pull/1) and thus decrease package size. This may be of limited impact as mentioned flypig due to the deprecation of QtWebkit in SailfishOS.
* `transfer-engine`, the backend to allow sharing data between apps, the request submitted by attah to [cleanup the naming scheme](https://github.com/sailfishos/transfer-engine/pull/9) in the examples to make them more clear to users, was accepted.
* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS / phone history, laakkonenjussi proposed a fix to the [failing test matching contacts](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/5).
* `timed`, the daemon handling the time and alarms, some [test fixing](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/1) by tomin1 related to the fact that the user is not named 'nemo' anymore.
* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, pvuorela proposed a [fix for tests loading events in time ranges](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/26) that were failing in relation to time zones. dcaliste is proposing a pull request modifying the code structure to [discouple SQLite storage from any calendar representation](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/28).
* `nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock`, QML bindings for device lock access, pvuorela [removed the unnecessary QtNetwork build dependency](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock/pull/3).
* `nemo-qml-plugin-time`, QML bindings for time handling (system wide clocksâ€¦), pvuorela [cleaned some test conditions where second accuracy leads to false negative](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-time/pull/2).
* `libiodata`, a library for reading and writing simple structured data, pvuorela [polished test reports](https://github.com/sailfishos/libiodata/pull/2) on the automated test farm.
* `gstreamer`, a multimedia framework, pvuorela [repackaged some development files to their own RPM](https://github.com/sailfishos/gstreamer/pull/2), not to clutter the main one used on device.
