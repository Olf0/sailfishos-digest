# Repository roundup


## The network stack

* `connectionagent`, a daemon and QML bindings to connect to ConnMan, **abranson** modified the DBus interface so [Wifi tethering and Bluetooth tethering can be manipulated separately](https://github.com/sailfishos/connectionagent/pull/3). Previous, the tethering API was implicitely dealing with Wifi thethering only. The pull request has not been accepted yet.

## Sound stack

* `amber-mpris`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **tomin1** added support over DBus to [expose non-hidden properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/23).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste**'s patch to [add a search method through out the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/49) has been merged. A (very) minor optimisation was proposed by **dcaliste** and accepted. It [avoids to poke the database for an event that is already in memory](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/55). Additionnaly, **dcaliste** proposes to [clean the code out of `::Ptr` type in the internal class handling read/write access to the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/56). It avoids to pin the data ownership to the current thread.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste** added a [list model to display search results](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/45) from the calendar database.

## Synchronisation framework

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **dcaliste** fixed [an issue when importing exception](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/20). Imported events didn't inherit the sync property like when creating an exception on device, confusing the sync plugin which was cancelling the import on the next sync round.

## System control

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** is proposing a fix for [deadlocking state on exit](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/7) due to pending interactions with `libgbinder`. **spiiroin** also [completed a large work on changing how refresh frequencies can be set-up](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/9). Indeed, rates of sensors depend on the device and the old API was quite restrictive because defined with integer millisecond periods, making not possible to choose a frequency of 400 Hz for instance (period would have been 2.5 milliseconds). **spiiroin** modified also the [granularity for accelerometers](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/10), previously stored as milliG integers, now moved to single precision floating point numbers.

* `qtsensors`, Qt bindings for the sensor framework, **spiiroin** ported his work on [allowing more fine grained frequencies in sensor refreshing to the bindings](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtsensors/pull/1).

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **keto** fixed a bug where [system CA certificates are not loaded](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/15).

## Low level libraries

* `sdl`, a multimedia library, **mlehtima** is working in a branch on [upgrading to the latest upstream version 2.26.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/tree/update_226).

* `firejail`, the isolation mechanism for process from the host system, **dsuni** [updated it to 0.9.72](https://github.com/sailfishos/firejail/pull/17).

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **neochapay** is [suspecting a double free in the plugin for `ffmemless`](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/8) (_i.e._ the vibration driver). The pull request is discussed with **pvuorela** and **monich**.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, the QML bindings for DBus, **attah**'s work [adding support for array of string-variant](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/13) key-value pairs, has been merged. This data type is used in the [standard FreeDesktop DBus methods for launching applications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus), so it enables apps to call those methods from QML. It has been branched also in `upgrade-4.5.0`, meaning that it will be available in a possible next hotfix release.

* `lvm2`, userland logical volume management tools, **mal** is working on an [update to 2.03.20](https://github.com/sailfishos/lvm2/tree/jb60487).

## SDK and developer tools

* `sailfish-secrets`, a framework to use encryption techniques, **sledges** updated the documentation to point to the right IRC channels (they were still the ones used on Freenode).

* `openssl`, utilities and library for cryptography, **direc85** contributed to the packaging, allowing to [wipe out the warnings from rpmlint](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssl/pull/5) and to build succesfully with `sfdk`.

## Sailfish OS website

* **jovirkku** updated the [release table with the 4.5.0.19](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/296) and added [all minor releases](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/297), see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Releases

* **jpwalden** created two pages describing [how to setup a freshly flashed device](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/289) with Sailfish OS, see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Help_Articles/Setting_up_a_Sailfish_Phone and https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Help_Articles/Setting_up_a_Sailfish_Phone_part2

* **vigejolla** complemented the synchronisation documentation with a [description of Buteo profiles](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/298), used to define synchronisation schedule for instance, see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Synchronization

* **jovirkku** added an article describing [how to use mapping services](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/300), taking among others PureMaps as an example, see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Help_Articles/Maps_and_Location_service/

* **jpwalden** created an article [describing the phone application](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/303), see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Help_Articles/Phone . He also added one for [the document application](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/305), see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Help_Articles/Documents and for the [calculator application](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/306), see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Help_Articles/Calculator

* **vigejolla** added a [reference description of the backup system](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/302), see https://docs.sailfishos.org/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Accounts_and_SSO/Backup_Accounts
