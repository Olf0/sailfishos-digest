# Repository roundup


## The network stack

* `connectionagent`, a daemon and QML bindings to connect to ConnMan, **abranson** modified the DBus interface so [Wifi tethering and Bluetooth tethering can be manipulated separately](https://github.com/sailfishos/connectionagent/pull/3). Previous, the tethering API was implicitely dealing with Wifi thethering only. The pull request has not been accepted yet.

## Sound stack

## Calendar stack

## Synchronisation framework

## System control

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** is proposing a fix for [deadlocking state on exit](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/7) due to pending interactions with `libgbinder`. **spiiroin** also [completed a large work on changing how refresh frequencies can be set-up](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/9). Indeed, rates of sensors depend on the device and the old API was quite restrictive because defined with integer millisecond periods, making not possible to choose a frequency of 400 Hz for instance (period would have been 2.5 milliseconds). **spiiroin** modified also the [granularity for accelerometers](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/10), previously stored as milliG integers, now moved to single precision floating point numbers.

* `qtsensors`, Qt bindings for the sensor framework, **spiiroin** ported his work on [allowing more fine grained frequencies in sensor refreshing to the bindings](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtsensors/pull/1).

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **keto** fixed a bug where [system CA certificates are not loaded](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/15).

## Low level libraries

* `sdl`, a multimedia library, **mlehtima** is working in a branch on [upgrading to the latest upstream version 2.26.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/tree/update_226).

* `firejail`, the isolation mechanism for process from the host system, **dsuni** [updated it to 0.9.72](https://github.com/sailfishos/firejail/pull/17).

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **neochapay** is [suspecting a double free in the plugin for `ffmemless`](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/8) (_i.e._ the vibration driver). The pull request is discussed with **pvuorela** and **monich**.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, the QML bindings for DBus, **attah**'s work [adding support for array of string-variant](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/13) key-value pairs, has been merged. This data type is used in the [standard FreeDesktop DBus methods for launching applications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus), so it enables apps to call those methods from QML. It has been branched also in `upgrade-4.5.0`, meaning that it will be available in a possible next hotfix release.

## SDK and developer tools

* `sailfish-secrets`, a framework to use encryption techniques, **sledges** updated the documentation to point to the right IRC channels (they were still the ones used on Freenode).
