Repository activities from 2022-05-27 to 2022-06-10
---------------------------------------------------

# Repository roundup

This last fortnight, over the 17 pull requests or activities reported in the open source repositories for Sailfish OS, 12 were contributions from the community. They cover fixes or improvements either for Sailfish OS but also for various other distributions (NemoMobile or others based on Yocto) where the code developed for and used within Sailfish OS is actually reused by other projects. This is a good signal for the health (and sustainability) of the project.

## Telephony stack

* `libwspcodec`, a library to encode / decode MMS, **slava** added a [fix for broken messages where the subject is empty](https://github.com/sailfishos/libwspcodec/pull/2) but wrongly encoded with a quote. This is fixing [the corresponding bug report](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/receiving-mms-fails-if-mms-contains-only-image-no-text/9902) from wetab73.

## Calendar stack

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **puretryout** asked for feedback on his pull request [to migrate from qmake to cmake](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/1). **dcaliste** asked for some changes to keep the automatic tests working.

## Contact stack

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, the plugin used by the synchronisation framework to sync contacts via the CardDAV protocol, **nephros** is suggesting to [add "X-SIP" and "X-JABBER" properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/2) in the exchange so they can be synced and appear in the people application.

## QML bindings

* `nemo-qml-plugin-alarms`, the QML for alarm access, **jmlich** would like to [extend the type of alarms sent to `timed`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-alarms/pull/2) (currently restricted to clock, reminder, countdown or calendar type) with another type called "wakeup". This distinction is used in Glacier UI. The difference between clock and wakeup is quite thin though and the pull request is still under discussion.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, the QML bindings for DBus, **herrie82** is proposing a patch so [the repo can compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/8).
* `nemo-qtmultimedia-plugins`, a plugin adding GStreamer as a QML video backend, **karry** found and [fixed a null pointer dereference](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qtmultimedia-plugins/pull/2) that without the fix leads to a crash in the initialisation routine.
* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **herrie82** [upgraded the source code base to be able to compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/9). The pull request is not yet accepted but close to being and generated a vivid discussion. **herrie82** also got a patch included so [the "Nemo" prefix to the QML import can be dropped](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/10) for other distributions other than Sailfish OS.
* `libqofono`, the QML bindings to Ofono, **herrie82** is proposing the same patch for Ofono this time to [be able not to use the "Nemo" prefix in QML imports](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/12).

## Low level

* `btrfs-balancer`, a utility to reduce meta-data space used in the BTRFS file-system, **olf** contributed a patch to [remove some Bash-only string substitution](https://github.com/sailfishos/btrfs-balancer/pull/17) in the script calling the file-system balance operation.

* `udisks2`, the udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices, implemented via DBus. **olf** fixed a shell script where [various quoting was not properly handled](https://github.com/sailfishos/udisks2/pull/7), which if unfixed raises potential issues when used with user names having spaces or special characters.

## Hardware adaptation

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, **thaodan** pushed a pull request [cleaning and fixing issues in the `mer-android-chroot` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/7) which was accepted.
* `droidmedia`, **thaodan** continues his work on [rewriting the miniaudiopolicy helper](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/92), adding support for earlier Android versions in addition to the existing 10 and 11.

## Software engineering

* `python-rpm-generators`, a tool to automatically add Requires/Provides and other types of dependencies based on egg/wheel metadata. **thaodan** is working in [a branch to update this package from upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-rpm-generators/tree/update_to_latest).
* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, the QML bindings for global settings, **neochapay** continues to polish his pull request to [make the "developer mode" optional](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/2) (not used in Nemo Mobile systems), following **pvuorela**'s review suggestions.

## SDK, documentation and developper tools

* `docs.sailfishos.org`, website sources, **olf** is proposing [some formatting changes in the newly introduced release page](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/87), still under discussion with **rainemak**.
* `osc`, the command line interface to work with OBS (the Open Build Service), **thaodan** and **mkosola** reached approval to [upgrade from 0.168.2 to 0.178.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/osc/pull/1).

# Apps ahoy!

In the early days of the Community News when things were only just getting started, we restricted the number of apps we covered to just four from those that received an update in the fortnight before. While trying out the different apps &mdash; and having the opportunity to really shake out the details &mdash; was a lot of fun, it was also disappointing to miss out all of the other wonderful apps that could have gone in.

Writing an app is a labour of love, and that deserves recognition. And while the most important recognition comes from the app's users themselves (please, if you're using an app, take the opportunity to comment, rate or favourite it!), it's always gratifying to be able to give a small additional nod to the authors in this newsletter too.

But while things have moved on, and we try now to be a bit more exhaustive with the apps that appear in this section, we still have to leave many deserving apps out. Among those are apps that are updated so frequently that we would have to include them every month if we were to stick to the principle. Apps like VideoWorks and Audioworks from prolific app-maintainer **poetaster**. And don't even get me started on all the apps receiving updates on OpenRepos and Chum, but which don't make it into harbour.

So we hope you enjoy the app updates below, but while you read them, please remember that these still represent just a small portion of the Sailfish OS apps that are getting love and attention from their authors all the time.

## Octava

Octava from Rustem Abzalov (**arustg**) is a relatively new app, and yet in the last few months has seen multiple updates. It's not a complex app, and doesn't claim to be, billing itself as a "Simple Piano Keyboard". If you want to play simple melodies you might just get away with it, as long as your tune doesn't span multiple octaves, and doesn't contain chords. Octava produces a nice rich piano sound, with some nice animations to highlight the key being played. If you're itching to tinkle the digital ivories, this is your opportunity. The latest update provides some subtle user interface improvements. But let's hope **arustg** adds multitouch support so we can really bash out those choruses! Version 0.3.1 of Octava is available from both the Jolla Store and [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/arustg/frome).

## All the News

Mark Washeim (**poetaster**) has been busy updated his apps again this fortnight. If you read the intro to this section, you'll know I missed out a bunch of his updates. But one that made it, and which we're really pleased to be able to cover, is All the News, which relaunches previous app *News Aggregater* but in a totally rewritten form. The story goes that **poetaster** wanted the app to live on, but after being unable to contact the original author, decided to rework the whole thing.

All the News makes use of the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/ ) backend to provide news feeds from a whole host of different providers from across the world. You'll need to get an API key from them for the app to work, but it's a super-simple process as long as you accept that they'll be storing some of your data. 

You can filter news based on language, country or topic, although not all of the topics have feed items associated with them (where are the gaming articles?!). Without any filtering the main page will be filled out with news sources, each with a brief description. With all filtering disabled I counted a total of 128 different sources from across the world. Tapping through gives you the latest ten headlines from the source. Tapping again opens the article on the source's website.

The app also supports searching by keyword, provides clear thumbnails for articles, and also proves to be a nice demonstration of the Sailfish OS language support.

Whether you're addicted to the headlines, or just someone who occasionally likes to keep up with events, All the News is a great way to find out what's happening all over the world, and avoid getting stuck in a social media news bubble. The latest version adds hints to help with API key usage. This latest version 0.4.0 is available from both the Jolla Store, [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/poetaster/all-news) and [Chum](https://build.sailfishos.org/package/show/sailfishos:chum/allthenews).

## Dino

Another release from Rustem Abzalov (**arustg**), Dino has also enjoyed multiple updates over the last few months. The game remains the same: our intrepid Tyrannosaurus must leap, bound and jump over all obstacles as they run majesticallly across the Upper Cretaceous plains of the past. Jump height is controlled by how long you press, and as our protagonist progresses further, it also runs faster, with new challenges in the form of floating obstacles that must also be avoided.

The latest version provides some subtle user interface improvements, a nice slick cover, and the same increasing difficulty curve. Version 1.1.1 is now available from the Jolla Store and [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/arustg/dino)

## Babbage

Babbage from Heiko Bauke (**rabauke**) is a new app for this newsletter, having just made the jump with the latest 0.18 update to 64-bit aarch64 devices. Babbage provides a nice and cleanly designed calculator that fits in well with the Sailfish Silica aesthetic. While ironically not Turing Complete, Babbage does nevertheless provide two different modes of different complexities. There's a simple "Pocket" variant with the usual quartet of operations, plus square root, exponentiation, brackets and <italic>&pi;</italic> for the edge cases that need them. But if you really want to make the most of Babbage you'll want to switch to the free-form "Scientific" variant. Here you can apply any of the 41 unary, binary and multiparameter functions that range from the standard trigonometric *cos*, *sin* and *tan* to more exotic statistical functions such as Student's t-distributions and Gamma functions. Thankfully there's a list of functions on the About page, so you don't have to remember them all yourself.

There are no shortage of calculator apps for Sailfish OS, and for more complex operations you can always drop to a Python console. But while not being a fully-fledged programming language, Babbage provides a good selection of more advanced functions and an interface that is much easier to use than the console, managing to maintain a careful balance between usability and functionality.

The latest update to Babbage is avilable on the Jolla Store, and for aarch64 users for the first time.

## SailBabel

Another nice app form Heiko Bauke (**rabauke**), once installed SailBabel will declare itself as simply "Dictionary" in your app drawer. A clean install will present a list of directories rather than a list of words: it's up to you to provide a word list, which can either be a list of translations or a list of definitions, so this can act as either type of dictionary. The *de-facto* choice for translation lists being [dict.cc](http://www1.dict.cc) with its rather pecular email-based [download process](http://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php?l=e). The wordlists come as text files which you can load directly into SailBabel, after which you can search the lists to display the results in a clean way, using different highlighting to distinguish between the search result and the translation or definition. The app also provides an easily accessible search history so you can skip forwards and backwards through your search terms.

The obvious competitor to SailBabel is Sebastian Wolf's (**WerkWolf**) Wunderfitz. While Wunderfitz has more features, with its scan-translations, toolbar and in-built dictionary list, there's an elegant simplicity to SailBabel that also makes it feel more responsive and lighter to use.

When it comes to either app, the experience is ultimately tied to the quality of the database in use. I found translating between Finnish and English using the [dict.cc](http://www1.dict.cc) database to be a bit hit-and-miss. Often the stem of the word &mdash; or [*vartalo*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vartalo) &mdash; exists in the database, but because neither app supports fuzzy search, getting at it wasn't always obvious, for me at least.

These are still both really nice apps to have for Sailfish OS, and if you want an offline dictionary you should definitely given SailBabel a try. It's available from the Jolla Store.

## Picross 2

We've covered Matti Viljanen's (**direc85**) Picross 2 on several occassions in the past, and it still holds up as one of my favourite puzzle games for Sailfish OS. Officially described as nonogram, but in my experience often referred to as Hanjie puzzles, you must fill in the grid of squares with either blocks or crosses, using only the numbers around the edge of the grid as clues. Picross 2 offers 103 hand-crafted puzzles with a gentle difficulty curve that starts with some easy tuturial and ends up with the aptly titled "Insane" levels. If you have time to spare, you could do worse than unspare it playing Picross 2. The latest version adds support for [My Backup](https://openrepos.net/content/slava/my-backup) and makes some adjustments to the user interface and translations. Version 2.5.0 is available from the Jolla Store and [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/direc85/picross-2 ).

## Frome

Rustem Abzalov (**arustg**) has been prolific in updating apps this fortnight. Frome is a simple app that makes it easy to calculate percentages, useful if you're calculating interest or tips. The interface is unusual but intuitive, with the buttons displayed as a row in pairs down the left or &mdash; with a configuration option &mdash; right hand side. A history of calculations then fills up on the edge without the numbers.

The latest release 0.3.5 fixes the clear function and is avilable from both the Jolla Store and [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/arustg/frome ).

## Evento

Updates to existing apps are great, but it's always nice to be able to include a new app or two in the newsletter. Evento is our first this fortnight from Samuel Kron (**black_sheep_dev**). Evento is a rather nicely presented app for counting up away from or down towards particular events. The options are still fairly basic, for example there's no way to have events that span multiple years like birthdays, to take events from the Calendar or to add alarms. But it makes for a nice first release. Getting used to the interface is near instant and I was very quickly able to add in some important dates, turning my general anxiety about how close my deadlines are into much more specific fear. Despite its early stage of development, there's already the option to sort the list of events in a variety or ways: how close they are, when they were added, or their title.

Evento is a great addition to the Sailfish OS catalogue, and we look forward to seeing more developments in future. This initial release is avialable from the Jolla Store, [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/blacksheepdev/evento) *and* [Chum](https://build.sailfishos.org/package/show/sailfishos:chum/harbour-evento).

## Porthole

The second new release from Samuel Kron (**black_sheep_dev**), Porthole allows you to control a [Pi-hole server](https://pi-hole.net/ ) for your local network. Although originally intended for use on a Raspberry Pi, Pi-hole will run on any Linux device, although it probably doesn't make sense to run it on your Sailfish phone directly. Pi-hole provides an add blocker that all clients on a network can make use of, essentially blocking content from certain domain names (those associated with ad providers) from being served.

Porthole allows you to see statistics about who is using the server and the sites being blocked, as controlling the server to enable and disable ad blocking.

Pi-hole is particularly useful for use with devices that don't themselves provide ad blocking, including the Sailfish Browser, but also extending to other devices such as smart devices. If you're running the server, you should definitely take a look at Samuel's app. This first release is available from the Jolla Store, [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/blacksheepdev/porthole) and [Chum](https://build.sailfishos.org/package/show/sailfishos:chum/harbour-porthole).

## Yatzy

We covered Yatzy recently after it had spent a bit of a multi-year haitus without updates. So it's great to see author **rgrnetalk** giving it some love and providing yet more updates to this rather nice dice game. Yatzy isn't Yahtzee, but it is a related Nordic game that plays along similar lines. Six dice are thrown and a pocker-style categorisation applied to the result. Getting one of each category, with the highest score possible, is the name of the game. It's a careful mix of strategy and luck, with some nice dice animation thrown in for good measure.

The latest update fixes some issues with the instructions and some fixes to the gameplay logic. Version 0.7 of Yatzy is available from the Jolla Store.

## Slideshow

Joni Korhonen (**pinniini**) is clearly into viewing photos in the cleanest way possible. Slideshow, as you might expect, allows you to create customisable slideshows of your best snaps.

Besides selecting the images using a variety of filtering techniques, you get a lot of configuration for your slideshow. Timing, looping and ordering can all be configured, and you can even set your slideshow to music. Once the slideshow is running the interface is &mdash; as you might hope &mdash; minimal. Everything is removed until you tap on the screen to pause, at which point you can continue again or back out of the slideshow completely.

Back in [November last year}(https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/sailfish-community-news-4th-november-berlin-helsinki/8846#sailphoto-13) we looked at SailPhoto for viewing photos. Slideshow is similar in many ways, but with a tighter focus on automated slideshows and less on photo organisation. Joni says this latest version 2.0.1 of Slideshow is a complete rewrite of the app, and it's already working nicely, providing both configurability and a responsive, easy-to-use interface. If I had to choose, I'm not sure whether I'd go for Slideshow or SailPhoto, but both do a good job if you want to display your photos in a gently soothing way. Slideshow is available now from the Jolla Store.

## Seabass

One of the things I've always loved about Sailfish OS is the ability to write code *directly on the device*, whether it be Python, C++ or QML code, you can type, compile and run it all without having to leave the safety of your phone. A good code editor is essential for this, and while it may be a rather niche requirement, in my opinion it's one of the things that makes Sailfish OS special. Consequently I always get a thrill of excitement when I see a good quality code editor getting a high quality update.

Up until now I've tended to use [Editor.](https://openrepos.net/content/goalexander/editor ) from Alexander Dydychkin (**GoAlexander**) or VIM in the console at a push. But Seabass from Mikhael Milikhin (**milikhin**) has now reached the stage where I'm seriously considering it as my go-to code editor of choice.

Recent updates have brought significant improvements to the interface. The switch to using the WebView makes everything that bit more responsive. The floating "swipe" button for enabling and disabling the pulley menus makes everything more functional, with nice unobtrusive positioning and iconography. The ability to set the file as read only remains a surprisingly useful touch, clearly the output of a mind focussed on how best to read and write code on a small display. And the same can be said for the arrow keys. Personally, I'd add arrow keys to the stock Sailfish OS keyboard if I could.

So I have to say, recent updates from Mikhael are bearing fruit, and Seabass is turning into a really nice developer-friendly editor. I'm looking forward to that tingle of excitement when new updates drop in the future.

Version 0.9.1 of Seabass is available from the Jolla Store and [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/mikhael/seabass).

## Patience Deck

Patience Deck is another app that's seen regular updates from my good colleague Tomi Leppänen (**tomin**) over the last year. If you've not yet tried it, then you clearly haven't been reading previous newsletters carefully enough! Patience Deck provides over a hundred different variants of card games you can play on your own (often referred to as Solitaire games, for obvious reasons). Some of the variants are classic (Klondike), some are excellent (Spider), some have odd names (Beleaguered Castle) and some are absolutely attrocious (Clock). All of them benefit from Tomi's impressive implementation with a variety of card types to choose from and intuitive drag-and-drop.

The latest version adds Swedish translations courtesy of Åke Engelbrektson and improves card clarity. This version 0.8.2 is available from the Jolla Store and [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/tomin/patience-deck ).

## SeaPrint

SeaPrint has become *the* way to print files from your Sailfish OS device. It should probably be built in to the operating system, but having it as a separate app doesn't hinder its capabilities, especially when paired with the [SeaPrint Share Plugin](https://openrepos.net/content/attah/seaprint-share-plugin ).

As long as your printer is on the network and supports the Internet Printing Protocol, you can send documents such as PDFs, LibreOffice, Microsoft Office and image files to it to be printed out. The results are generally excellent, and it really feels like **attah** has found the right way for printing to be implemented on a mobile device. Amazing work. In the background the app uses Calligra to perform conversion in case the printer doesn't support the format directly.

The latest version 1.1.5 fixes a bug with zero-length printer responses and cleans up the user interface a little. It's available from the Jolla Store, with the SeaPrint Share Plugin on [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/attah/seaprint-share-plugin ).
