# Repository roundup

This last forenight, over the 17 pull requests or activities reported in the open source repositories for SailfishOS, 12 were contributions from the community. They cover fixes or improvements either for SailfishOS but also for various other distributions (NemoMobile or others based on Yocto) where the code developped for and used within SailfishOS is actually resued by other projects. This is a good signal for the health (and sustainability) of the project.

## Telephony stack

* `libwspcodec`, a library to encode / decode MMS, **monich** added a [fix for broken messages where the subject is empty](https://github.com/sailfishos/libwspcodec/pull/2) but wrongly encoded with a quote. This is fixing [the corresponding bug report](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/receiving-mms-fails-if-mms-contains-only-image-no-text/9902) from wetab73.

## Calendar stack

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **puretryout** asked for feedback on his pull request [to migrate from qmake to cmake](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/1). **dcaliste** asked for some changes to keep the automatic tests working.

## Contact stack

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, the plugin used by the synchronisation framework to sync contacts via the CardDAV protocol, **nephros** is suggesting to [add "X-SIP" and "X-JABBER" properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/2) in the exchange so they can be synced and appear in the people application.

## QML bindings

* `nemo-qml-plugin-alarms`, the QML for alarm access, **jmlich** would like to [extend the type of alarms sent to `timed`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-alarms/pull/2) (currently restricted to clock, reminder, countdown or calendar type) with another type like "wakeup". This distinction is used in Glacier UI. The difference between clock and wakeup is quite thin though and the pull request is still under discussion.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, the QML bindings for DBus, **herrie82** is proposing a patch so [the repo can compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/8).
* `nemo-qtmultimedia-plugins`, a plugin adding GStreamer as QML video backend, **karry** found and [fix a null point dereference](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qtmultimedia-plugins/pull/2) leading to a crash in the initialisation routine.
* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **herrie82** [upgraded the source code base to be able to compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/9). The pull request is not yet accepted but close to and generated a vibid discussion. **herrie82** also got a patch included so [the "Nemo" prefix to the QML import can be dropped](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/10) for other distributions than SailfishOS.
* `libqofono`, the QML bindings to Ofono, **herrie82** is proposing the same patch for Ofono this time to [be able not to use the "Nemo" prefix in QML imports](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/12).

## Low level

* `btrfs-balancer`, an utility to reduce meta-data space used in BTRFS file-system, **olf** contributed a patch to [remove some Bash-only string substitution](https://github.com/sailfishos/btrfs-balancer/pull/17) in the script calling the file-system balance operation.

* `udisks2`, the udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices, implemented via D-Bus. **olf** fixed a shell script where [various quoting was not properly handled](https://github.com/sailfishos/udisks2/pull/7), raising potential issues when used with user names having spaces or special characters.

## Hardware adaptation

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, **thaodan** pushed a pull request [cleaning and fixing issues in the `mer-android-chroot` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/7) was accepted.
* `droidmedia`, **thaodan** continues his work on [rewriting the miniaudiopolicy helper](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/92), adding support for earlier Android version in addition to the existing 10 and 11.

## Software engineering

* `python-rpm-generators`, a tool to automatically add Requires/Provides and other types of dependencies based on egg/wheel metadata. **thaodan** is working in [a branch to update this package from upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-rpm-generators/tree/update_to_latest).
* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, the QML bindings for global settings, **neochapay** continues to polish his pull request to [make the "developper mode" optional](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/2) (not used in Nemo Mobile system, following **pvuorela** review suggestions.

## SDK, documentation and developper tools

* `docs.sailfishos.org`, website sources, **olf** is proposing [some formatting changes in the newly introduced release page](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/87), still under discussion with **rainemak**.
* `osc`, the command line interface to work with OBS (the Open Build Service), **thaodan** and **mkosola** reached approval to [upgrade from 0.168.2 to 0.178.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/osc/pull/1).
