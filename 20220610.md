# Repository roundup

This last fortnight, over the 17 pull requests or activities reported in the open source repositories for Sailfish OS, 12 were contributions from the community. They cover fixes or improvements either for Sailfish OS but also for various other distributions (NemoMobile or others based on Yocto) where the code developed for and used within Sailfish OS is actually reused by other projects. This is a good signal for the health (and sustainability) of the project.

## Telephony stack

* `libwspcodec`, a library to encode / decode MMS, **slava** added a [fix for broken messages where the subject is empty](https://github.com/sailfishos/libwspcodec/pull/2) but wrongly encoded with a quote. This is fixing [the corresponding bug report](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/receiving-mms-fails-if-mms-contains-only-image-no-text/9902) from wetab73.

## Calendar stack

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **puretryout** asked for feedback on his pull request [to migrate from qmake to cmake](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/1). **dcaliste** asked for some changes to keep the automatic tests working.

## Contact stack

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, the plugin used by the synchronisation framework to sync contacts via the CardDAV protocol, **nephros** is suggesting to [add "X-SIP" and "X-JABBER" properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/2) in the exchange so they can be synced and appear in the people application.

## QML bindings

* `nemo-qml-plugin-alarms`, the QML for alarm access, **jmlich** would like to [extend the type of alarms sent to `timed`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-alarms/pull/2) (currently restricted to clock, reminder, countdown or calendar type) with another type called "wakeup". This distinction is used in Glacier UI. The difference between clock and wakeup is quite thin though and the pull request is still under discussion.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, the QML bindings for DBus, **herrie82** is proposing a patch so [the repo can compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/8).
* `nemo-qtmultimedia-plugins`, a plugin adding GStreamer as a QML video backend, **karry** found and [fixed a null pointer dereference](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qtmultimedia-plugins/pull/2) that without the fix leads to a crash in the initialisation routine.
* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **herrie82** [upgraded the source code base to be able to compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/9). The pull request is not yet accepted but close to being and generated a vivid discussion. **herrie82** also got a patch included so [the "Nemo" prefix to the QML import can be dropped](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/10) for other distributions other than Sailfish OS.
* `libqofono`, the QML bindings to Ofono, **herrie82** is proposing the same patch for Ofono this time to [be able not to use the "Nemo" prefix in QML imports](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/12).

## Low level

* `btrfs-balancer`, a utility to reduce meta-data space used in the BTRFS file-system, **olf** contributed a patch to [remove some Bash-only string substitution](https://github.com/sailfishos/btrfs-balancer/pull/17) in the script calling the file-system balance operation.

* `udisks2`, the udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices, implemented via DBus. **olf** fixed a shell script where [various quoting was not properly handled](https://github.com/sailfishos/udisks2/pull/7), which if unfixed raises potential issues when used with user names having spaces or special characters.

## Hardware adaptation

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, **thaodan** pushed a pull request [cleaning and fixing issues in the `mer-android-chroot` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/7) which was accepted.
* `droidmedia`, **thaodan** continues his work on [rewriting the miniaudiopolicy helper](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/92), adding support for earlier Android versions in addition to the existing 10 and 11.

## Software engineering

* `python-rpm-generators`, a tool to automatically add Requires/Provides and other types of dependencies based on egg/wheel metadata. **thaodan** is working in [a branch to update this package from upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-rpm-generators/tree/update_to_latest).
* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, the QML bindings for global settings, **neochapay** continues to polish his pull request to [make the "developer mode" optional](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/2) (not used in Nemo Mobile systems), following **pvuorela**'s review suggestions.

## SDK, documentation and developper tools

* `docs.sailfishos.org`, website sources, **olf** is proposing [some formatting changes in the newly introduced release page](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/87), still under discussion with **rainemak**.
* `osc`, the command line interface to work with OBS (the Open Build Service), **thaodan** and **mkosola** reached approval to [upgrade from 0.168.2 to 0.178.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/osc/pull/1).
