# Repository roundup

Intro

## Telephony stack

`liqofonoext`, a library for accessing Sailfish OS specific ofono extensions, **mal** is proposing new code [adding support for 5G properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofonoext/pull/3).

## Browser stack

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **nephros** got his patch on copied URL, reviewed and included. It is modifying the new function to copy the current URL to the clipboard so [it is using percent encoded form](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1004) and thus be a valid URL and not a beautified one.

* `qtwebkit5`, Qt bindings for the webkit HTML engine, **vigejolla** is [adding a dependency on the Sailfish webview package for QML bindings](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtwebkit5/pull/6).

## Multimedia stack

* `ffmpeg`, a framework to encode and decode multimedia resources, after an upgrade from **mal** last month to 5.1.1, `ffmpeg` has been moved to [the latest upstream version 5.1.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/ffmpeg/pull/4) thanks to **mal** again.

* `gstreamer`, a multimedia framework, the same happened to gstreamer which is also closely following upstream bug fix releases with an [upgrade to 1.20.4](https://github.com/sailfishos/gstreamer/pull/4), with **mal**'s PR. Update was also done on various plugins, like the [base ones](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-plugins-base/pull/5), the [glue to `libav`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-libav/pull/3), the [bad(-ly written) plugins](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-plugins-bad/pull/3) and the [good ones](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-plugins-good/pull/4).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** changed the validation logic so that [changes to any incidence can be written to the database, irrespective of the read-only status of the notebook they belong to](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/34). The read-only status is now only treated as a hint for UI (for instance birthday events cannot be changed in the calendar application), but the code actually updating the event when a birthday is modified, does not need anymore to flip the read-only flag before doing the change.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-webcal`, a sync plugin to sync web calendar resources, **dcaliste** [simplified the code when syncing changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-webcal/pull/4) since flipping the read-only flag is not necessary anymore.

* `buteo-sync-plugins-social`, several sync plugins for Google, Facebook and other proprietary protocols, as for other sync plugins, the code has been [simplified not to flip the read-only flag](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/6) to sync changes from the server.

* `contactsd`, the daemon handling contacts, the code was also simplified, [removing the necessity to flip the read-only flag on changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/contactsd/pull/4).

* `buteo-sync-plugin`, the original sync plugin with SyncML code, **dcaliste** [replaced a call to `createDefaultNotebook()` from mKCal](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins/pull/2). It was the only place in all Sailfish OS that this function was called. After this change, it can be safely removed from mKCal API, reducing maintainance burden. 

## Low level libraries and utilities

* `mapplauncherd`, the daemon responsible to start applications faster thanks to preloading, **martyone** ensured that [success is returned on exit if the option `--no-wait` is used](https://github.com/sailfishos/mapplauncherd/pull/15).

* `PackageKit`, a D-Bus abstraction layer that allows the session user, **pvuorela**'s large work to get a [major update from 1.1 to 1.2.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/PackageKit/pull/1) has been merged in.

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **martyone** has opened a merge request to [rework packaging and move the vendor data examples with all other examples](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/11).

* `sailfish-fonts`, a package to gather fonts used in the OS, this repository that was previously stored with proprietary bits of SailfishOS is now [hosted on Github](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-fonts`).

## SDK and building tools

* `automake`, the infamous GNU build system - Makefile generation, **mal** is proposing an [upgrade to 1.16.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/automake/pull/1).

* `patch`, the tool to update code from differences, **pvuorela** [updated it from upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/patch/pull/1), so it is compatible with new bison version 3.8. He also cleaned up the spec file in the process.

* `ruby`, the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming, **thaodan** fixed a [bootstrap issue with newer bison 3.8](https://github.com/sailfishos/ruby/pull/4) and thus [deprecated earlier attempt to workaround it](https://github.com/sailfishos/ruby/pull/3).

* `orc`, a library to generate optimized code operating on arrays of data, **mal** [updated it to 0.4.33](https://github.com/sailfishos/orc/pull/4).

* `extra-cmake-modules`, , **dcaliste** proposed to [upgrade it to version 5.99](https://github.com/sailfishos/extra-cmake-modules/pull/3) (it was previously at 5.90). Version 5.91 is actually needed to build the latest KCalendarCore.
