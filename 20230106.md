# Repository roundup

As announced in the last community letter, a candidate version is currently internally tested to become the version 4.5.0. This is visible in the repositories where sometime a branch called `upgrade-4.5.0` is created. When such a branch exist, it means that some bug has been found in the candidate version. Bugs are then corrected in the master branch, and the correction is backported for the 4.5.0 version. Worth mentioning also is the current transition in QML import naming schemes. Old `Meego.xxx` and `org.nemomobile.xxx` are either dropped or replaced by `Nemo.xxx`. This is taking place gradually and not all QML bindings have been updated already.

## Telephony stack

* `mobile-broadband-provider-info`, the database of access point configurations, **atlochowski** updated the [TMobile credentials in the UK](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/16). He also updated the [MMS settings for EE in the UK](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider

* `ofono`, the telephony library, **slava** found and [fixed a use after free issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/40).

* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, **jmlich** spotted [an installation issue for the test and fixed it](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/15). **pvuorela** [dropped the `Meego.xxx` in the QML import naming convention](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/16). The old naming convention is still possible, but [it is emitting a warning now](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/18). **jmlich** proposes to [update the test and example application since the modems are loaded asynchronously](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/17).

## Audio stack

* `amber-mpris`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **tomin1** [fixed an issue on client side with the seek position](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/14).

## Networking

* `nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity`, QML bindings for network connectivity, **mal** [fixed a use after free case](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity/pull/5) when technology is changed.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **pvuorela** [dropped the `Meego.xxx` in the QML import naming convention](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/15). Like for qofono, the old naming convention can still be used, but [it will emit a warning](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/17). **pvuorela** also [proposes to drop `NetworkManager::getTechnology()` from QML API](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/16) because ownership is not clear and to replace it with a simpler `hasTechnology(string)`.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [increased the delay to get IPv4 connection](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/37) from the network. It seems that with VoLTE, this can be longer than the previous 2 seconds delay. **LaakkonenJussi** also proposed to [uniformise the enum values between VPN and provider](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/38).

## The browser

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **pvuorela** [updated the `import` statements](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/163) dropping the old `Meego.xxx` naming convention.

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **pvuorela** [updated the import statements](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1008) to use the new `Nemo.xxx` naming convention.

## Synchronisation framework

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, **pvuorela** updated the permission file by allowing to read the new location for sync profiles (now in `~/.local/share/system/privileged/msyncd/sync`). The change has been ported into a upgrade-4.5.0 branch, to be seen as a bug fix for internal testing version 4.5.0.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **pvuorela**, following his [changes on mKCal on organiser storage](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/36), simplified the serialisation to iCal format when uploading a new or a modified event to a server, by [removing the additionnal code always removing the organiser from the attendee list](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/12).

* `buteo-sync-plugins-social`, several sync plugins for Google, Facebook and other proprietary protocols, as for the CalDAV plugin, **pvuorela** [simplified the code handling organizers and attendees](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/7).

* `buteo-syncfw`, the framework handling synchronisation, **dcaliste** [fixed an issue when moving the sync profiles from the old to the new location](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/11). The change has also been ported into a upgrade-4.5.0 branch.

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **pvuorela** [fixed a long-lasting legacy where mKCal is enforcing the organizer into the attendee list](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/36). **dcaliste** found [yet another case of alarm misbehaving for recurring events](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/38) when an exception is removed. **pvuorela** [corrected the `mKCal::Notebook` default constructor that was missing the UUID generation](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/41). **pvuorela** also [removed a deprecated call to `Incidence::setHasGeo`](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/42). The various changes have also been ported into a upgrade-4.5.0 branch.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, **dcaliste** changed back the behaviour when deleting an exception in a recurring event, to [deleting also the occurrence of the recurring event](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/40). The change has also been ported into a upgrade-4.5.0 branch.

## Low level libraries
