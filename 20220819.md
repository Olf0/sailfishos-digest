Repository activities from 2022-08-05 to 2022-08-19
---------------------------------------------------

It was already mentioned during the last community meeting on IRC, and the various commits of the last 15 days confirm it, there will be many new API allowed in harbour with next Sailfish OS version. This is visible with changes to `sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator` repository, but it becomes also possible thanks to the upgrade in documentations of the various implied packages.

Another noticable direction pointed by the recent commits, is the work on making builds reproducible. This is an important measure to check against regressions during development and deployment.

## Homescreen

* `lipstick`, the compositor and main user interface of your phone, **Tomin1**'s pull request about [supporting an `X-DBusActivatable` key](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/27) in desktop files, has been approved.

* `timed`, time and alarm handling daemon, the pull request from **teleshoes** to allow the [`MaximalTimeoutSnoozeCounter` attribute to be set](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/2 ), has been reviewed and merged. This would allow a snooze counter to be added via the command line.

## Contact stack

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, a plugin for synchronising contacts, **HenkKalkwater** has proposed a pull request to [fix CardDav syncing with NextCloud servers](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/3) where the `.well-known` index redirect omits the hostname. This addresses the [bug raised on the forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/4-4-0-58-carddav-sync-with-nextcloud-fails/11033) about the issue. The fix has been accepted and merged after some review from **pvuorela**.

## Network stack

* `wpa_supplicant`, for accessing WPA and WPA2 protected WiFi networks, **Thaodan** and **pvuorela** continued their work to [upgrade to the upstream version 2.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/wpa_supplicant/pull/4).

## Multi-user support

* `user-managerd`, a daemon used for managing Sailfish OS device users via DBus, the pull request to [guard against user files being removed](https://github.com/sailfishos/user-managerd/pull/44) for the system user, from **krnlyng**, has been merged.

* `sdk-build-tools`, a package of scripts used to build the Sailfish SDK, **martyone**'s pull request to [include a manifest file](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-build-tools/pull/123) in the sdk archives, has been accepted.

* `sdk-setup`, the pull request to fix a bug that [prevented arguments being passed](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/331) through from `sfdk make` when `%make_build` is used in an application's spec file, from **martyone*, has been merged. Also from **martyone**, the pull request to [allow a broader range of tag names](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/330) in projects to be picked up by the build process, has also been merged.

* `sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator`, the harbour validation scripts, **vigejolla** [added Sailfish Secrets](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/154) to the allowed API in harbour, but also its [QML plugin](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/155). [Qt Location (up to version 5.4) will be allowed](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/157) (Qt Positioning was already allowed). Using [Mpris QML bindings will also be allowed in harbour](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/158) with next Sailfish OS version, through the use of `Sailfish.Media` import.

## Software engineering

* `python3`, the popular and widely used programming language, **Tomin1**'s pull request to [update the python3 package](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3/pull/4) with a patch from Fedora so that `rpmbuild` uses a timestamp from the changelog, has been approved.
