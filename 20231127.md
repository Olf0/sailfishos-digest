# Repository roundup

## Browser stack

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, a lot of activity took place in the branch dedicated to upgrading the browser to ESR91 version. **mal** fixed [builds for non aarch64 architectures](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/157/commits/685d9013505d4e460a07f3f255bb02acd665f846), **rainemak** [fixed the touch screen issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/157/commits/3ee581f38267d6d5ba47aa6b1a3f675bf0bb7f5b), while **flypig** continued [improving the upgrade](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/157).

## Communication services

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** upgraded to the upstream branch [implementing IPC through DBus](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/9). This is coming in conjunction with a [change in email permissions](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/141) for `sailjail`, since the message server is now using DBus instead of a Qcop socket. **pvuorela** cleaned the upstream and the code in patches [not to get warnings anymore during compilation](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/10). **dcaliste** reworked the patches and proposed to [separate into two the main patch](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/11) to be able to slowly try to integrate it upstream.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **simonschmeisser** exposed in QML email list models [the response status of an email](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/12) (replied, forwarded...). **dcaliste** [flagged the outgoing emails](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/14) with a response status, when necessary.

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **slava** externalised the code into a new library `libnfcdef` responsible to build and parse NDEF data. NDEF means NFC Data Exchange Format and is the [syntax used between devices and tags](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beginning-nfc/9781449324094/ch04.html). `nfcd` has been [updated to use this new library](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/14). `libnfcdef` integration is still pending though, and **slava** started [a new branch](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/17) to continue the development based on this new library.

## Multimedia

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **simonschmeisser** while testing **mal**'s developments on Camera2 API, opened two new issues: one about [exposure correction](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/issues/118) and one about using the [flash as a torch](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/issues/117).

* `ffmpeg`, a framework to encode and decode multimedia resources, **poetaster** proposed to [add compilation of support for text drawing](https://github.com/sailfishos/ffmpeg/pull/9). This would allow text overlays and subtitles in Videoworks, for instance.

## User interface

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** restarted the work from **robang74**, [making the README file more up-to-date](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/43), with a [new pull request](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/44).

## Low level libraries

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **Tofee** fixed a build issue for the Yocto distribution when using meta-qt6. Because of wrongly set macro variable, [`sensorfw` was looking for modules in at the wrong path](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/20). **Herrie82** is working on making the [changes for LuneOS](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/21) accepted in SailfishOS. While these changes concerned newer versions of Qt, some also deal with how the package is built with libhybris. After some exchanges with **mal**, **Tofee** is proposes a [simpler version](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/22).

* libdbusaccess, providing more fine-grained D-Bus access control, **slava** pushed 5 new commits, [tidying the build process](https://github.com/sailfishos/libdbusaccess/commits/master).

* `libglibutil`, a library extending GLib with convenient utilities, following an [issue with hidden symbols](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/issues/8) when built with CLang, **slava** ensured that [all (and only) required symbols are exported](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/10). **slava** also proposed to clean warnings due to [issues with C cast in code](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/9).

## Developper's corner

* `llvm`, the machinery to build compilers, **piggz** proposed to [package the `lld` excetable](https://github.com/sailfishos/llvm/pull/5), which is a linker coming with LLVM tool chains and needed to build Android kernels for instance.

* `gcc`, the GNU compiler collection, **mal** created a branch where he [backported two patches fixing two different compiler internal errors](https://github.com/sailfishos/gcc/commits/jb61045).

* `hw-ramdisk`, tools to be used to create init ramdisk for booting Sailfish OS, **mal** created a patch [adding support for lz4](https://github.com/sailfishos/hw-ramdisk/pull/5) compression, and also [disabled parallel builds](https://github.com/sailfishos/hw-ramdisk/pull/6).
