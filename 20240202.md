* `rygel`, a collection of UPnP/DLNA services, **mal** [upgraded it to 0.42.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/rygel/pull/2).

* `qtgrilo`, a framework for discovering and browsing media, Qt bindings, **pvuorela** added a property [signaling a fetching data state](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtgrilo/pull/3).

* `amber-mpris`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **tomin1** [fixed a segmentation fault](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/25) in the property change timer.

* `libsdl-gfx`, the simple direct media layer - graphics primitives, **Thaodan** [removed upstream enabling MMX on Arm](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-gfx/pull/2).

* `sdl`, a multimedia library, **mal** worked in a branch to [upgrade it to version 2.30.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/tree/jb61492). He also upgraded add-on libraries in the process, with [`libsdl-mixer`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-mixer/pull/5) to 2.8.0, [`libsdl-image`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-image/pull/4) moving to 2.8.2, and [`libsdl-ttf`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-ttf/pull/2) to 2.22.0.

## Communication bits

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** modified it to [emit a change signal also when default service is changed](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/46), so higher layers can properly interpret it. **LaakkonenJussi** also worked to [reduce the difference with upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/55) by selecting several upstream commits.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, [completely moved route parsing into ConnMan](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/19).

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** [merged latest upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/13), bringing a fix for [`*.asc` attachments being not displayed](https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt-labs/messagingframework/+/529726) in the email application.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **dcaliste** [fixed a bug creating duplicated files](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/18) on attachment download. The change also allows to save the attachments directly in `~/Downloads/` instead of putting them in a complex tree structure, and is currently under discussion.

* `bluez5`, the Linux Bluetooth stack, **mal** [moved to version 5.72](https://github.com/sailfishos/bluez5/pull/11).

## User interface

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **krnlyng** [added a signal](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/49) when the client closes a window. This signal (`terminated`) notifies that the application associated with the surface has terminated abnormally. This is based on `qtwayland` [signaling when the client destroys a surface](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtwayland/pull/3).

## Other applications

* `sailfish-office`, the document application, **dcaliste** proposed to [store passwords for read-protected PDF documents](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-office/pull/193).

## Low level libraries

* `tzdata`, the time zone data (and some other geographical data), **mal** proposed to [update it to 2023d](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata/pull/3).

* `zypper`, a package manager, **mal** [updated it to 1.14.68](https://github.com/sailfishos/zypper/pull/2) and its [library companion to 17.31.28](https://github.com/sailfishos/libzypp/pull/4).

* `python3-zypp`, Python module for zypper, **mal** [fixed compatibility with `libzypp` 17.29.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-zypp/pull/4).

* `aspell`, a spell checker, **markolemmetty** [updated it to 0.60.8.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/aspell/pull/1), fixing [CVE-2019-25051](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vm7w-rc54-7m7r) vulnerability.

* `fakeroot`, gives a fake root environment, **mal** [updated it to 1.29](https://github.com/sailfishos/fakeroot/pull/1).

* `libsoup3`, the web access library based on GObject, is a new repository separated from older version 2 of the `libsoup` library. **mal** [started it with version 3.4.4](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsoup3/commits/master/).

* `ca-certificates`, the system-wide authentication certificates, **mal** [updated them to 2023.2.62_v7.0.401](https://github.com/sailfishos/ca-certificates/pull/2).

## Developper's corner

Thaodan removed the `%make_install` macro for RPM packaging. He thus fixed many packaging directives in various repositories:
- in [`telepathy-accounts-signon`](https://github.com/sailfishos/telepathy-accounts-signon/pull/2),
- in [`tzdata-timed`](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata-timed/pull/4),
- in [`libmlocale`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libmlocale/pull/4),
- in [`qr-filter-qml-plugin`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qr-filter-qml-plugin/pull/8),

There is also an on-going maintainance task to remove the static libraries (and `libtool` .la files) from the distributed package when they don't make sense. This obviously will reduce a bit the download and installation footprint for the next update:
- in [`util-linux`](https://github.com/sailfishos/util-linux/pull/7),
- in [`gdb`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gdb/pull/3),
- in [`qtwayland`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtwayland/pull/2),
- in [`procps`](https://github.com/sailfishos/procps/pull/2),
- in [`qtbase`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtbase/pull/16),
- in [`btrfs-progs`](https://github.com/sailfishos/btrfs-progs/pull/3),
- in [`gmime`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gmime/pull/2),
- in [`libpcap`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libpcap/pull/2),
- in [`libsdl-sound`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-sound/pull/2),
- in [`udisks2`](https://github.com/sailfishos/udisks2/pull/10),
- in [`libusb1`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libusb1/pull/5),
- in [`nspr`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nspr/pull/4),
- in [`connman-network-monitor`](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman-network-monitor/pull/2),
- in [`libsdl-gfx`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-gfx/pull/1),

* `grep`, the searching command line tool, **mal** [replace the dependency on `pcre` with `pcre2`](https://github.com/sailfishos/grep/pull/2).

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **mal** backported [fixes to build against newer `glibc`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/158).

* `sailfish-secrets`, a framework to use encryption techniques, **mal** [fixed a compilation issue with newer `g++`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets/pull/190).

* `osc`, the command line interface to work with OBS (the Open Build Service), **thaodan** is proposing to [upgrade from 0.168.2 to 1.5.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/osc/pull/1).

* `PackageKit`, a D-Bus abstraction layer that allows the session user, **mal** backported a [fix for `gcc` 10](https://github.com/sailfishos/PackageKit/pull/2).

* `libglibutil`, a library extending GLib with convenient utilities, **slava** [added a function, `gutil_idle_pool_get_default()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/12), making usage of `GUtilIdlePool` simpler in multi-threaded environments. **slava** also modified this class with [two commits](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/13), one treating NULL parameter as the default pool and another returning the value as pushed to the pool.

* `qemu-usermode`, a universal CPU emulator, **mal** changed the `statx` call to [use the one from `glibc` instead of the syscall one](https://github.com/sailfishos/qemu-usermode/pull/2). Like that sb2 will be able to intercept the call.

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **mal** added a [wrapper for `statx` call](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/25). **Thaodan** [replaced deprecated `egrep` and `fgrep`](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/26) and [used the GNU option](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/27) for regexp instead of the Posix one (the version of `sed` is currently too old for that).

* `libshadowutils`, a library to used shadow tools, **Thaodan** [updated it to 0.0.4](https://github.com/sailfishos/libshadowutils/pull/1), also upgrading the packaging to use `cmake` macros and packaging Sailfish OS changes as a patch.
