# Repository roundup


## The network stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** fixed [problem on device start-up](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/40) when the communication devices are not yet set-up while the system tries to apply regulatory domain from the timezone reading. **LaakkonenJussi** is also proposing to [reverse the commit adding longer timeout to establish connection](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/42). It seems that it's not solving the problem.

## The telephony stack

* `ofono`, the telephony library, **mal** got his [work on 5G support](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/40) merged in.

* `liqofonoext`, a library for accessing Sailfish OS specific ofono extensions, **mal** [added support for 5G properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofonoext/pull/3).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** fixed an issue [affecting recurring alarms](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/57) (see https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/calendar-alarms-dont-work-if-reminder-time-is-in-previous-month-e-g-event-on-april-1-1-00-and-reminder-two-hours-earlier-i-e-on-march-31-23-00/15263). **dcaliste** is also proposing a pull request to [include recurring events in search results](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/58) so they can appear with their next occurrence, even if they started a long time ago (like birthdays).

* `contactsd`, the daemon handling contacts, **dcaliste** submitted a pull request [not to clear birthday alarms](https://github.com/sailfishos/contactsd/pull/7) when a birth date is changed.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, **dcaliste** pushed a request to be able to [save modifications to notebooks with the read-only hint](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/50), like birthday ones.

## Low level libraries

* `sdl`, a multimedia library, **mlehtima** continues to work in a branch on [upgrading to the latest upstream version 2.26.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/tree/update_226).

* `libglibutil`, a library extending GLib with convenient utilities, **slava** pushed various commit, including [runtime version checks](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/commit/c745e8b7bd4bc229f29d2dda13f262af6659f43f) or [tools to handle TLV data encoding](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/commit/1fde537ce515fd0351e08eabc1737a1a19379783) (see this Wikipedia page on [Type-Length-Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93length%E2%80%93value)s).

* `libmce-glib`, Glib client for mce, **spiiroin** added [support for `MceInactivity`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libmce-glib/pull/1) which expose device inactivity. The pull request also contains a commit adding a example program on how to use the Glib bindings to Mce.

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** added [proper initialisation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/11) avoiding warnings at construction time. **spiiroin** also [fixed a missed conversion](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/13) since internally sensorfw is now using micro-seconds but still report milli-seconds over DBus.

## SDK and developer tools

* `sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator`, the harbour validation scripts, **vigejolla** [added a warning](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/173) when the `X-Sailjail` section is missing from the desktop file.

* `less`, which is more powerful than `more`, **mal** packaged it and [added it](https://github.com/sailfishos/less) in the distribution.

* `amber-web-authorization`, a QML module allowing applications to perform OAuth1 and OAuth2 requests, **vigejolla** [migrated its documentation](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-web-authorization/pull/8) to use Sailfish template instead of Mer one.

* `sdk-user-manual`, examples and documentation for the SDK, **vigejolla** also [migrated the documentation of this package](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-user-manual/pull/13).

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, **vigejolla** added [a sentence explaining the `Privileged` permission](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/139).

* `sailjail`, a wrapper around firejail, **vigejolla** [clarified documentation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail/pull/76) for the `--trace` argument.
