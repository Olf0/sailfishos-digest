# Repository roundup


## The network stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **Laakkonenjussi** [fixed an inconsistentcy between reported device power state and technology (like Wifi) power state](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/43/files). This resulted sometimes in Wifi reporting no networks.

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** changed the `ServiceHandler` plugin API to [reduce the exposure of `ExtendedStorage` and `ExtendedCalendar` objects](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/39). Indeed, these objects cannot be maintained since upstream KCalendarCore is dropping notebook support in calendars. **pvuorela** [clean-up the packaging to avoid exporting private headers](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/62).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste** [propagated changes in `ServiceHandler` API](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/52). He also [simplified internally how events are stored](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/53), using a global identifier for every events (including exceptions) instead of multi hastables based on event UID (exceptions shares the same UID as their recurring event). **pvuorela** [cleaned up the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/55) that was using private headers from `mKCal`. **dcaliste** also proposed a [fix to some segfaults](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/56) appearing on test quits. Finally, he worked on a large simplification, [proposing to drop the `recurrenceId` argument](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/54) in favour of a global unique identifier. This work is still under discussion and is breaking the calendar QML API for functions like `deleteEvent()`.

## Positioning

* `qtlocation`, Qt modules to handle positioning and location, **poetaster** started [backporting changes in map provider URLs](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtlocation/pull/2), so the rather old code currently in `QtLocation` can display again QML maps.

## Low level libraries

* `mapplauncherd-booster-browser`, preload common browser QML components to get faster application starts, **rainemak** [dropped the old `booster-browser.service` SystemD service](https://github.com/sailfishos/mapplauncherd-booster-browser/pull/2). This service is no longer needed as there is a unified one that works both for email and browser.

* `timed`, time and alarm handling daemon, **pvuorela** proposed to fix an issue raised by **Laakkonenjussi** while working on regulatory domain adjustments. The code is [now comparing paths instead of inodes](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/7) (for symlinks, the inode stay the same while the target may change).

## SDK and developer tools

* `sailjail`, a wrapper around firejail, **rainemak** [clarified the documentation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail/pull/78), emphasing that Firejail is executed with command line arguments provided by Sailjail.

* `voicecall`, the open source part of the calling application, **pvuorela** [created (back) a `-devel` package](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/12). This is following the request from **Michal-Szczepaniak** proposing to [package again the header files](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/11), so plugins can be compiled against `voicecall`. As **pvuorela** mentioned, it does not mean official "support for the out-of-tree plugins nor API stability promises".

* **mal** added missing license file in packaging both for [`sqlite`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sqlite/pull/4) and [`zlib`](https://github.com/sailfishos/zlib/pull/3).
