# Repository roundup

## Communication bits

* `libqofonoext`, Qt bindings for specific Sailfish OS extension to Ofono, PR from **pvuorela** to [convert the NCI property into a string](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofonoext/pull/6) was accepted. The current declaration as an enum with 64 bits values is not ideal since not working in QML. NCI is the id of the cell used in a 5G network.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-social`, social QML adapters for Nemo, **Karry**'s work on [giving read-only access to the shared calendars](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/11) with Google, has been merged in. **pvuorela** modified the plugin to [ensure that only events are synced](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/12), excluding things like out of office notices...

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste** [fixed an issue when creating exceptions of recurring events](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/61) that prevented the additional properties to be passed from the parent to the exception.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [worked on OpenVPN plugin](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/61), so it can work with version 2.6.9. The [documentation has been updated](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/63) for new OpenVPN options. **pvuorela** proposed to stop [`connman` repeatedly trying to set online a modem that is powered off](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/62). This happens for instance when an Android device shares it connection via Bluetooth with a Sailfish OS device and the two devices are disconnected. **LaakkonenJussi** found and fixed a crash with OpenFortiVPN when [connecting to a server with invalid credentials](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/64).

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **pvuorela** [limited the number of NetworkManager instances in a process](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/27) to ideally just one, by adding a shared instance API. This was then applied in various packages, like [`nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/43), [`connectionagent`](https://github.com/sailfishos/connectionagent/pull/5), [`nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity/pull/10).

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **pvuorela** [removed many unused or deprecated parts from the build system and in the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/17).

## User interface

* `nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock`, QML bindings for device lock access, **spiiroin** [added placeholders for authentication methods](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock/pull/8), for later usage.

* `kf5-calendarcore`, the KDE framework library to handle calendar data, **pvuorela** [fixed an upstream bug breaking visibility change for notebooks](https://github.com/sailfishos/kf5-calendarcore/pull/14). KDE is not using the notebook capabilities of KCalendarCore and its support has been removed in KDE Framework 6, that's how it has been left unnoticed there.

## Multimedia

* `tracker-miners`, metadata extractors for tracker, [upgrade to 3.3.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/tracker-miners/pull/10) from **mlehtima** has been accepted.

* `gst-droid`, plugin for GStreamer allowing to use hardware accelerated codecs, **simonschmeisser** changed to [use a real value instead of an integer](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-droid/pull/80) to be sent to the droid camera code.

## Low level libraries

* `tzdata`, the time zone data (and some other geographical data), **mal** [updated it to 2024a](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata/pull/3).

* `tzdata-timed`, the time zone data (and some other geographical data), **mal** [updated the MCC data base](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata-timed/pull/5), allowing to link time zones with the geographical zone reported by the modem.

* `libqtsparql`, the Qt support for SPARQL databases, **pvuorela** [exported some missing functions for plugins](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqtsparql/pull/11) by making them visible from the library file.

* `openssl`, utilities and library for cryptography, **Thaodan** worked on an [update to 3.2.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssl/pull/7). A legacy `openssl1.1` repository has been created to keep the older version available, as it is still used by some packages, like [`qtbase`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtbase/pull/17) for instance.

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **pvuorela** [fixed some unit tests](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/10) and also [some memory leaks](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/11).

* `util-linux`, a collection of basic system utilities, **mal** proposed to [disable CD-ROM probing](https://github.com/sailfishos/util-linux/pull/8) since it creates a kernel crash on some Unisoc devices due to ioctl number collision with ufs_sprd driver ioctls.

* `xz`, LZMA compression utilities, **mal** proposed to [update it to 5.4.6](https://github.com/sailfishos/xz/pull/1). This is still before the backdoor that exists in version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. As [explained by **mal**](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/release-notes-struven-ketju-4-5-0-eula-update/18127/84), Sailfish OS is not impacted since it's building from git sources and not from a distribution tarball.

* `mce`, mode control entity, **mal** proposed to [expose the `battery_charging_enabled` entry from the kernel](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/26), to allow to pull power for the device from an USB link without charging the battery.

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **mal** worked to [support Android sensor device API 1.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/25).

## Developer's corner

* `python3`, the popular and widely used programming language, **mal** [updated it to 3.8.18](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3/pull/5).

* `libsdl-gfx`, the simple direct media layer - graphics primitives, **Thaodan** [removed upstream enabling MMX on Arm](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-gfx/pull/2). **mal** [cleaned up the `spec` file](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-gfx/pull/3) used for packaging.

* `android-tools`, the Android tools, **Thaodan** proposed to [change the packaging of the Android tools](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools/pull/2), for it to be based on the NDK tools, as it is already done by some other distributions.

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, now that `android-tools` is based on NDK tools, **Thaodan** [removed them from the HADK packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/10).

* `pkgconf`, package compiler and linker metadata toolkit, **Thaodan** [proposed an initial packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/pkgconf/pull/1) of this tool.

* `rpm`, a software package format and tools, **Thaodan** [factorized the `spec` file for the packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/rpm/pull/15).

* `meego-rpm-config`, specific rpm configuration files for Sailfish OS, **Thaodan** [changed three elements in the RPM macro definitions](https://github.com/sailfishos/meego-rpm-config/pull/6): remove the (modified) copy of `%make_install` in favour of `%qmake5_install` when applicable (the pristine `%make_install` from the `rpm` package is still available but not overloaded anymore), removing of `la` files (internal files generated b `libtool`) from packages [through a new `brp-remove-la-files` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/rpm/pull/14), and an explicit handling of static libraries.

* `transfer-engine`, the backend to allow sharing data between apps, **ilpianista** worked on making possible that [a file downloaded in a browser private mode, may not appear in the transfer list](https://github.com/sailfishos/transfer-engine/pull/14).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to access system parameters, up to [this change](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/42) from **pvuorela**, `ssu` was used in various places to get an id representing the device. Now this package is providing it for C++ code. The dependency on `ssu` has then been changed in various packages to use `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings` instead:
 - in [`buteo-mtp`](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-mtp/pull/13),
 - in [`obex-capability`](https://github.com/sailfishos/obex-capability/pull/3),
 - in [`crash-reporter`](https://github.com/sailfishos/crash-reporter/pull/56).

It avoids to create an instance of SSU to simply get a device id.

* `sailfish-qtcreator`, the Qt IDE, **martyone** fixed [build-shell.args being ignored by some commands](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/557) like `make` or `deploy` for instance.

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **martyone** fixed [`ldconfig` being used at build time](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/29) and also [tools working with `LD_PRELOAD`](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/30). He flagged [`sh` and `bash` to be accelerated](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/31) also when they have been moved under `/usr`. **Thaodan** proposed a large set of changes [removing multiarch for x86_64 and also using more Autotools capabilities for out of tree builds](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/32).

* `python3_urllib3`, Python module for URL manipulations, **nephros** [updated it to 1.26.18](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-urllib3/pull/3), as required as dependencies by some packages like `yt-dlp` for instance.

* `python3-requests`, Python module to execute HTTP requests, **nephros** proposed to [update it to 2.31.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-requests/pull/4).
