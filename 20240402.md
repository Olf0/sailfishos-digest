# Repository roundup

## Communication bits

* `libqofonoext`, Qt bindings for specific Sailfish OS extension to Ofono, PR from **pvuorela** to [convert the NCI property into a string](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofonoext/pull/6) was accepted. The current declaration as an enum with 64 bits values is not ideal since not working in QML. NCI is the id of the cell used in a 5G network.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-social`, social QML adapters for Nemo, **Karry**'s work on [giving read-only access to the shared calendars](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/11) with Google, has been merged in. **pvuorela** modified the plugin to [ensure that only events are synced](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/12), excluding things like out of office notices...

## Location services

## User interface

* `nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock`, QML bindings for device lock access, **spiiroin** [added placeholders for authentication methods](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock/pull/8), for later usage.

* `kf5-calendarcore`, the KDE framework library to handle calendar data, **pvuorela** [fixed an upstream bug breaking visibility change for notebooks](https://github.com/sailfishos/kf5-calendarcore/pull/14). KDE is not using the notebook capabilities of KCalendarCore and its support has been removed in KDE Framework 6, that's how it has been left unnoticed there.

## Browser stack

## Multimedia

* `tracker-miners`, metadata extractors for tracker, [upgrade to 3.3.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/tracker-miners/pull/10) from **mlehtima** has been accepted.

## Other applications

* `tzdata`, the time zone data (and some other geographical data), **mal** [updated it to 2024a](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata/pull/3).

* `tzdata-timed`, the time zone data (and some other geographical data), **mal** [updated the MCC data base](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata-timed/pull/5), allowing to link time zones with the geographical zone reported by the modem.
