# Repository roundup

There is a lot of activity in **mal**'s branch introducing camera 2 API, from community members, opening issues for discussion or proposing pull requests for bug fixing or implementation. A notable change in the repositories is also the removal of all newly relicensed repositories. Maybe an issue with the relicensing procedure, time will tell.

## Communication services

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **slava** fixed a [memory leak](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/12) and also added support for [MediaType NDEF records](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/13). NDEF means NFC Data Exchange Format and is the [syntax used between devices and tags](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beginning-nfc/9781449324094/ch04.html).

* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS/phone history, **neochapay** worked on changes to be able to [compile this library with Qt 6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/8).

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** opened a pull request allowing to use the upstream branch [implementing IPC through DBus](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/9). This should be used in conjunction with a [change in email permissions](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/141) for `sailjail`, since the message server is now using DBus instead of a Qcop socket.

## Browser

* `nspr`, platform independence for non-GUI operating system facilities like threads, file and network IOâ€¦, **flypig**, in his quest to upgrade the browser, [updated it to 4.35](https://github.com/sailfishos/nspr/pull/3).

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **flypig** [documented his effort to upgrade to ESR 91](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/labels/esr91), creating a list of issues detailing the various adjustments he made for the project to compile and execute. Such noticies have also been created for other projects like, [`qtmozembed`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/labels/esr91) or [`gecko-dev`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/labels/esr91).

## Audio and video layer

* `alsa-utils`, CLI tools for ALSA, **mal** fixed the [path to `alsactl`](https://github.com/sailfishos/alsa-utils/pull/3) in the UDEV rules.

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **simonschmeisser** [fixed an issue in exposure compensation setting](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/113) when used with a locale using something different from the english dot '.' character. **thigg** is working on [zoom implemention](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/115) and compatibility with older Android base (like for the XA2). All this work is based on the current branch dealing with camera 2 API from **mal**. [Several issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/issues/116) have been opened also to discuss the current status of the implementation.

## Low level libraries

* `curl`, the command-line tool to access the web, **attah** [updated it to 8.4.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/curl/pull/5).
