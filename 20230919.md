# Repository roundup

The nemo mobile community members continued their work to update all packages where Sailfish OS is the upstream maintainer, to be used in conjunction with Qt5 and Qt6. While **flypig** continues his tremendous work of upgrading the Gecko engine from ESR 78 to ESR 91, the browser that is based on, received some nice polishing, with changes allowing to interact with images.

## Communication services

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, a plugin for synchronising contacts, **jmlich** opened a request to [support Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/5).

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** updated it to the [latest upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/7), bringing a way to flag encrypted emails and also some better attachment detections in some corner cases.

* `libsocialcache`, a library and a QML plugin that is used to manage cache from social networks, **jmlich** worked on [upgrading it for Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsocialcache/pull/1).

* `buteo-mtp`, an MTP library, **jmlich** has a work in progress on [updating it to Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-mtp/pull/11).

* `nfcd`, a daemon for near-field communications, **monich** pushed several commits [improving test support and documentation](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/commits/master).

## Browser

* `embedlite-components`, QML components for the browser, **rainemak** added a [title in the context menu](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/95) when long tapping on an image that is not a link by itself.

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **mal** and **rainemak** added an entry in the context menu to [copy the URL of an image to the clipboard](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/165) and to make this menu appears when long tapping an image. **thigg** mentioned that this change would now allow to read all XKCBâ€¦ **rainemak** then later updated this change with another, [adding an expander for the cases of long titles](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/166).

## User interface

* `sailfish-utilities`, the setting page to restart failing services, **ichthyosaurus** contributed a patch to [add a restart button for the keyboard subsystem](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-utilities/pull/66).

## Audio and video layer

* `libwebp`, a library for encoding and decoding image in WebP format, **attah** [upgraded it to 1.3.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/libwebp/pull/4), bringing a fix for [CVE-2023-4863](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr).

## Low level libraries

* `libglibutil`, a library extending GLib with convenient utilities, **JamiKettunen** [replaced explicit calls to `make` with a variable](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/5), and later [removed the overload](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/6) of this variable. This gives the possibility to use the build system of the package with another make implementation.

* `lz4`, an extremely fast compression algorithm, **mal** created a [new repository](https://github.com/sailfishos/lz4) for this upstream library.

* **Thaodan** is fixing the packaging of Qt components, putting data in architecture specific directories when needed.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, the QML bindings for DBus, **jmlich** updated it [to be used with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/14).

## SDK and developer tools

* `python3-jinja2`, a template engine in Python, **mal** [updated the package](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-jinja2/pull/2) to version 3.1.2.

* `python-markupsafe`, implements a XML/HTML/XHTML markup safe string, **mal** [moved it to version 2.1.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-markupsafe/pull/1).

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **Thaodan** proposed [various fixes in the way the package is built](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/23).

* `rust-cbindgen`, utilities to create C/C++11 headers for Rust libraries, **flypig** [updated it to 0.19.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/rust-cbindgen/pull/7).

* `icu`, International Components for Unicode, **flypig** also [updated it to 70.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/icu/pull/1) during his odissey to upgrade Gecko engine. **rainemak** mentioned during the last community meeting that both `rust-cbindgen` and `icu` updates actually fixed a build issue with `xulrunner` on armv7hl architectures, nice!

* `gcc`, the GNU compiler collection, **direc85** investigated a compiler crash reported by **flypig** and [backported a patch from upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/gcc/pull/4).
