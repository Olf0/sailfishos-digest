# Repository roundup

Intro

## Telephony stack

* `mobile-broadband-provider-info`, the database of access point configurations, **neochapay** contributed [updates to TMobile networks](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/15).

* `voicecall`, the opens source part of the calling application, **pvuorela** reworked the [ringtone playback request send by the application on incoming call](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/8). He mentioned in the pull request description: "The ringtone playback might depend on the caller contact details". Is it a step in the direction of per-contact ringtone, or more flexibility to get ringing phone in not-disturb mode for specific contacts ? Let's wait and seeâ€¦

## Multimedia

* `opus`, an audio codec for use in low-delay speech and audio communication, **mal** [disabled the unit tests during packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/opus/pull/1).

* `qtdocgallery`, Qt module to create a gallery, **pvuorela** adjusted the [life-time of the main object to avoid being deleted too late](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtdocgallery/pull/5). This was creating issues when disconnecting from tracker.

## Network

* `wpa_supplicant`, for accessing WPA and WPA2 protected WiFi networks, **thaodan** [updated it to 2.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/wpa_supplicant/pull/4), and refactored packaging.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** synchronized with various upstream commits [fixing several security issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/32), and also [updating scripts to use Python 3](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/33).

## Browser

* `gecko-dev`, the browser engine, **flypig** [linked the colour scheme to the `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` setting](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/149), so the ambience can influence the colour scheme.
