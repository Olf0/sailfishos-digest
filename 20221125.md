# Repository roundup

I've been thrilled by two recent works this fortnight. One has been mainly driven by **flypig** and will allow to have the browser follow the ambience major, wheter it is a light or a dark ambience. It has been a long time since there has been no development related to ambience integration and having the browser following the scheme is a very nice addition. The second commit that attracted my attention was submitted by **pvuorela** in `voicecall` repository. But I let you read it further…

## Telephony stack

* `mobile-broadband-provider-info`, the database of access point configurations, **neochapay** contributed [updates to TMobile networks](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/15).

* `voicecall`, the opens source part of the calling application, **pvuorela** reworked the [ringtone playback request send by the application on incoming call](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/8). He mentioned in the pull request description: "The ringtone playback might depend on the caller contact details". Is it a step in the direction of per-contact ringtone, or more flexibility to get ringing phone in not-disturb mode for specific contacts ? Let's wait and see…

* `sailfish-log-viewer`, an application to fetch logs, **slava** [uploaded his `harbour-logger` application](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-log-viewer) under the main Sailfish OS repositories. This application can be used to gather logs from the telephony stack.

## Multimedia

* `opus`, an audio codec for use in low-delay speech and audio communication, **mal** [disabled the unit tests during packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/opus/pull/1).

* `qtdocgallery`, Qt module to create a gallery, **pvuorela** adjusted the [life-time of the main object to avoid being deleted too late](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtdocgallery/pull/5). This was creating issues when disconnecting from tracker.

* `alsa-lib`, the library to handle the sound using the ALSA interface, **mal** [updated it to 1.2.8](https://github.com/sailfishos/alsa-lib/pull/1).

* `alsa-plugins`, the plugins for ALSA, **mal** [updated it to 1.2.7.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/alsa-plugins/pull/1).

* `alsa-utils`, CLI tools for ALSA, **mal** [updated it to 1.2.8](https://github.com/sailfishos/alsa-utils/pull/2).

* `libsdl`, a multimedia library, **mal** is working on [updating it to 2.26](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/tree/update_226).

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, thaodan got merged his proposition to [improve the documentation for the "custom" sound effect](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/6), as supported or not by the hardware.

## Network

* `wpa_supplicant`, for accessing WPA and WPA2 protected WiFi networks, **thaodan** [updated it to 2.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/wpa_supplicant/pull/4), and refactored packaging.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** synchronized with various upstream commits [fixing several security issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/32), and also [updating scripts to use Python 3](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/33). **LaakkonenJussi** submitted a pull request [not to timeout VPN that are waiting for credentials](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/34).

## Browser

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **flypig** changed the timing of [tab opening at startup to ensure that tab opened by an external application can be closed](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1006) also (like for a OAuth process). **flypig** also proposed to add a new combo box in the setting page to [select the preferred colour scheme](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1007).

* `gecko-dev`, the browser engine, **flypig** [linked the colour scheme to the `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` setting](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/149), so the ambience can influence the colour scheme.

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **flypig** [described the new property for colour scheme change](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/161), allowing the web pages to follow the ambience light or dark theme.

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **flypig** [binded `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` with the new colour scheme property](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/47).

## Synchronisation

* `buteo-syncfw`, the framework handling synchronisation, **pvuorela** [moved the files used by Buteo](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/10), like the profile descriptions or the logs, from `.cache/msyncd` to `.local/share/system/privileged/msyncd`.

* `buteo-sync-plugins`, various plugins including Bluetooth synchronisation, **pvuorela** used the [new data location to avoid the deprecated cache location](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins/pull/3).

* `buteo-syncml`, the SyncML plugin, **pvuorela** also [updated the data location](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncml/pull/2).

## Main user interface

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** got a request in to [expose `removeNotification()` to the public QML API](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/33). He also re-added the [led blinking for instant messaging notification](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/34) (notification feedback being under rework).

## Low level libraries and utilities

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **martyone** has [reworked packaging and moved the vendor data examples with all other examples](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/11). **rainemak** completed the task by making the ['ssu-vendor-data' package a dependances for 'ssu-ks'](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/12).

* `tzdata-timed`, the time zone data (and some other geographical data), **dsuni** updated [the script parsing the wikipedia pages listing the MCC](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata-timed/pull/2) and updated the database. He also updated the [unsupported zones](https://github.com/sailfishos/tzdata-timed/pull/3). MCC values are used to guess the time zone from the MCC value reported by the modem.

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, **flypig** added the [authorisation for the contact application to talk to the browser application via DBus](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/135). This allows the contact application to open and close tabs in the external browser for the import wizard.

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** [added a DBus method to poll if the device can suspend charging or not](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/17). This is usefull to show or hide the hysteresis controls.

* `mce-dev`, developer portion of mode control entity, **spiiroin** [added a constant to use the DBus query to know if charging can be suspended](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce-dev/pull/5).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, a QML component used by the Settings app, **spiiroin** added a [QML property exposing the possibility for the device to suspend charging](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/31).

* `qtbase`, the Qt library, **rainemak** is proposing a patch to [interpret touchevents sent by `evdev` as pencil events](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtbase/pull/13).

* `usb-moded`, the USB tracking daemon, **neochapay** is proposing a pull request [adding missing includes](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/11). **spiiroin** addressed an issue [for devices which does not report proper charging states](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/12) (like cable connected...) via the usual `power_supply` device. In that case, he added support for the `extcon` subsystem to provide such charging information for `usb-moded`.

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** fixed the issue with [recurring alarms not taking into account exceptions](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/35).
