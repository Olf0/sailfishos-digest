# Repository roundup

There has been several new repositories arriving in Github. They are containing code developped by Jolla, previously under a proprietary license, now available to the open source community under a BSD 3-clauses license. Everyone can submit PRs, propose changes… and interact with Jolla to bring new functionalities, correct bugs, provide documentation for these parts of the OS.

## Communication services

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **slava** [marked the NDEF tag as initialised](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/10) in some cases where the reactivation response times out. He fixed a possible crash when the [target disappears instead of reactivating](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/11), and a [memory leak](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/12). Finally, **slava** also proposed to add support for [MediaType NDEF records](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/13). NDEF means NFC Data Exchange Format and is the [syntax used between devices and tags](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beginning-nfc/9781449324094/ch04.html).

## Browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **flypig** proposed a draft [upgrading the engine to ESR91](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/157).

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **flypig** is actively working on [propagating the changes in libXUL API](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/49) after the switch to ESR91.

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser itself, **flypig** published a [draft on the engine upgrade to ESR91](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1015).

## User interface

* `sailfish-secrets`, a framework to use encryption techniques, **dcaliste** adjusted the code [not to show again the confirmation to access a GnuPG secret](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets/pull/189) if it was dismissed by the user just before.

* `sailfish-components-gallery`, QML components to handle the image and video gallery, is a new repository with code that has been [relicensed to BSD](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-gallery/commit/5705c1193b5c3d94eeb2b93fa872c799890224b1).

* `sailfish-components-filemanager`, QML components to create a file manager, is also a new repository with code relicense from proprietary to BSD. It comes with the full commit history, with an initial commit from Joona Petrell back in 2016, stating “[Create a simple file manager. Contributes to JB#5771](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-filemanager/commit/016b4b1fcaa8347f3cfc11ae0a01eb299c321312)”.

* `sailfish-locale`, some localization defintions, is a new repository. **dcaliste** patched a [spelling mistake](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-locale/pull/1) for the FR locale definition file.

* `sailfish-minui`, a simple UI loop to allow user interaction, is also a new repository allowing user interaction in a graphical way without having a full user session started. This can be used to ask passphrases early in boot for instance.

* `sailfish-components-accounts`, QML components on top of the account framework, allows to create and manage accounts (like iCal subscription, IMAP email server…). Its history goes back to december 2012 with an initial commit from Chris Adams.

* `sailfish-device-encryption`, encryption at device level, is the last new repository listed this fortnight. It contains all the pieces used to handle the encryption at device level, from the encryption service to the unlock UI.

## Audio and video layer

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **mal** pushed a branch with [initial support for the Camera 2 API](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/tree/camera2), see his message on the forum: https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/camera2-api-development/14491/29.

## Low level libraries

* `declarative-transferengine`, QML components for the share mechanism, is a new repository. The code license has been [changed from proprietary to BSD 3 clauses](https://github.com/sailfishos/declarative-transferengine/commit/e01a51a479cc7ded72795f071369082eb3dde9b0).

## SDK and developer tools

* `hw-ramdisk`, tools to be used to create init ramdisk for booting Sailfish OS, **mal** proposed a patch [adding support for lz4](https://github.com/sailfishos/hw-ramdisk/pull/5) compression.

* `libcap-ng`, a library for Linux that makes using POSIX capabilities easier, **thaodan** [updated the packaging to be in phase with Fedora and upgraded the library to 0.8.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcap-ng/pull/2).

* `llvm`, the machinery to build compilers, **rubdos** is investigating the [upgrade to 15.0.7](https://github.com/sailfishos/llvm/pull/3) or [16.0.6](https://github.com/sailfishos/llvm/pull/4).

* `sailfish-svg2png`, tools to generate images at different resolutions from SVG files, yet another new repository with code relicensed.
