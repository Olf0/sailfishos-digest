# Repository roundup

After the update of accounts to better support latest Microsoft flavour of OAuth2 and the continuing effort on low-level library updates, the last fortnight brought (almost) the conclusion to the new charging settings. In the next (large) update, there will be the possibility to adjust charging of the phone in a finer way, including an hysteresis on full charge to limit battery aging. 

## Accounts

* `signon-plugin-oauth2`, a plugin to handle OAuth2 protocol, **tomin1** opened a pull request adding [parameters passed to plugins](https://github.com/sailfishos/signon-plugin-oauth2/pull/3). This allows sending non-standard query items to server. For example, Microsoft identity platform uses this to know that it should prompt user to select account.

## Power management

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** corrected the [broadcast over DBus of the charging control states](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/15), so client can listen to change and not only stay on the values set at initialisation time. **martyone** fixed some issues found by review in his pull request to [ensure that hysteresis controls are applied only once after full charge is reached](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/13). **spirroin** is also opening a pull request [polishing the charge settings](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/16).

* `mce-dev`, mode control entity - developper access, **spirroin** is proposing to [add DBus constants to allow to override the charging policy](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce-dev/pull/4).

* `libmce-qt`, Qt bindings for `mce`, **spiiroin** finalised his work on [providing support for charge states (and charge hysteresis)](https://github.com/sailfishos/libmce-qt/pull/1).

* `lipstick`, the compositor and main user interface of your phone, **spiiroin** [removed the "Not enough power to charge" warnings when using the new charge states](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/28) and letting the battery discharge when plugged on to avoid saturating at 100%.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, a QML component used by the Settings app, **martyone** is proposing a pull request to allow the [charging hysteresis to be managed](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/29). And **spirroin** completed the work with a pull request [exposing charging status](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/30).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** opened a pull request, cherry-picking changes from an [earlier pending pull request](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/30) cleaning up internally the cases where [a runtime only calendar doesn't require to access the storage](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/34).

## Low-level system libraries

* `PackageKit`, a D-Bus abstraction layer that allows the session user, **pvuorela** has worked on a [major update from 1.1 to 1.2.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/PackageKit/pull/1). This required to update most of the commits specific to Sailfish OS.

* `lksctp-tools`, user-space access to Linux kernel SCTP, **mal** pushed it to the [version 1.0.19](https://github.com/sailfishos/lksctp-tools/pull/1). SCTP is like TCP transport protocol, except that is can guarantee ordered message delivery (and many other things).

* `hunspell`, a spell checker and morphological analyzer library, **mal** [updated the package from version 1.6.2 to 1.7.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/hunspell/pull/2).

* `screen`, a screen manager that supports multiple logins on one terminal, **pvuorela** [updated the package from 4.7.0 to 4.9.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/screen/pull/3). He profited to clean up the spec file in the process.

* `mesa`, graphic libraries, **mal** is proposing to [update to 21.3.9](https://github.com/sailfishos/mesa/pull/2). The update relies on a pending upgrade of LLVM though.

* `python-yaml`, YAML parser/emitter for Python, **nephros** is proposing to [update to the latest version](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-yaml/pull/1) of the 5 branch series. This will allow to update the `yq` tool in Chum.

* `LLVM`, the machinery to build compilers, **rubdos** who [started working on an LLVM upgrade](https://github.com/sailfishos/llvm/pull/1), requested help to finish the update. **mal** [proposed himself and is continuing the work](https://github.com/sailfishos/llvm/pull/1#issuecomment-1276035321).

* `gecko-dev`, the browser engine, **mal** added [a branch for LLVM upgrade](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/tree/jb58952).

* `rust-cbindgen`, cbindgen creates C/C++11 headers for Rust libraries, **mal** is [working on a update of the package](https://github.com/sailfishos/rust-cbindgen/tree/update-test). At this stage, it's still a test branch.

* `rust`, the Rust programming language compiler, **mal** opened two branch testing the upgrade of Rust to [1.61](https://github.com/sailfishos/rust/compare/master...rustc-1.61) or [1.64](https://github.com/sailfishos/rust/tree/update_1_64).

* `curl`, the command-line tool to access the web, **pvuorela** is [updating it to 7.85.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/curl/pull/3), also clean-up patches for a better alignment with Fedora.

* `zxing`, a codebar library, **pvuorela** [updated the package](https://github.com/sailfishos/zxing/pull/2).

## SDK

* `automake`, the infamous GNU build system - Makefile generation, **mal** has created a [branch to upgrade it to 1.16.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/automake/tree/update).

* `autoconf`, the infamous GNU build system - automatic system detection, **mal** is proposing to [upgrade it to 2.71](https://github.com/sailfishos/autoconf/pull/1) (from 2.69).

* `ruby`, the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming, **mal** is working in a [branch where he picked a commit from upstream updating the build system for Autoconf 2.70](https://github.com/sailfishos/ruby/tree/jb58921).

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **mal** has opened a pull request where [`autoreconf` is used when building the package](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/19), to avoid missing files like `config.sub` and `config.guess` now required by newer `autoconf`.

* `sdk-setup`, part of the Sailfish SDK, **martyone** [modified `mb2`, `sdk-manage` and `sdk-assistant` to be aware of snapshots](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/334). Indeed, when building, to preserve the original build image, builds (and possible installation) are done in a dedicated snapshot of the build image. Now, snapshots are not listed by default with such tools.

* `sailfish-qtcreator`, the Qt IDE, **martyone** added [a `--snapshots` option to `sfdk` to list the snapshots on-deamnd only](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/536). He also djusted the documentation for `mb2`.

* `sample-app-cppqml`, a demo application featuring QML interface to C++ code, **rainemak** [cleaned up its packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/sample-app-cppqml/pull/2) and [rename the repository for consistency](https://github.com/sailfishos/sample-app-cppqml/pull/3).

* `sample-app-c`, a demo application featuring command line interface, **rainemak** and **vigejolla** created this [new repository to give an example of a command line tool](https://github.com/sailfishos/sample-app-c) using pkg-config to access a system library.
