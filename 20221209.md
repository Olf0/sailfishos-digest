# Repository roundup

The latest commits in Sailfish OS repositories confirmed the recent work on 5G support, and are also bringing various tiny fixes here and there, like in the browser, the calendar, the VPNâ€¦ Many small changes that squash irritating small bugs for the user. We just need to wait now for the public release to get rid of them !

## Telephony stack

* `ofono`, the telephony library, **mal** pushed his [work on 5G support](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/40) as a pull request.

* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, **pvuorela** [hided the symbols that were only privately used](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/13) by the library, gaining 50kB on the file in the process.

* `libgofono`, a glib-based wrapper for ofono D-Bus interfaces, **slava** [freshened up the MCC table](https://github.com/sailfishos/libgofono/commit/f0ea43cbf5513456ee8953fd0070c6d1e30abda5).

* `sailfish-log-viewer`, an application to fetch logs, **vigejolla** [updated the application with latest developments](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-log-viewer/pull/2) from **slava** (fixing linking and translation issues and adding the metadata for Chum).

## Browser stack

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **flypig** [binded `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` with the new colour scheme property](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/47).

* `gecko-dev`, the browser engine, **flypig** [linked the colour scheme to the `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` setting](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/149), so the ambience can influence the colour scheme.

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **flypig** fixed an [issue on height calculation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/162) with the help of **poetaster**.

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **flypig** added a new combo box in the setting page to [select the preferred colour scheme](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1007).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **pvuorela** is proposing to [fix a long-lasting legacy where mKCal is enforcing the organizer into the attendee list](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/36). **dcaliste** found [yet another case of alarm misbehaving for recurring events](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/38) when an exception is removed. **dcaliste** is also proposing to [evolve the plugin API](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/39), to avoid the usage of `::Ptr` and also to [ensure at database level that deleting a recurring event is also deleting its exceptions](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/40). Finally, **dcaliste** is currently working on an [asynchronous implementation of the database access](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/37). If successfull, it may replace the current asynchronous implementation in the QML bindings and unify the usage of `KCalendarCore::Incidence` from mKCal to the QML bindings.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **pvuorela**, following his [changes on mKCal on organiser storage](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/36), is proposing to simplify the serialisation to iCal format when uploading a new or a modified event to a server, by [removing the additionnal code always removig the organiser from the attendee list](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/12).

## Network stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** is still working on a pull request [not to timeout VPN that are waiting for credentials](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/34).

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** is [exposing a new `association` state for VPNs](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/12). **neochapay** [has fixed the warnings](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/11) emitted when compiling with more recent versions of Qt. **elro34** found and [fixed a memory leak on DBus exposition of technology changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/13).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings for various system parameters, **LaakkonenJussi** [added an `association` state to the VPN status](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/32) when the VPN is waiting for credentials for instance.
