# Repository roundup

## Telephony stack

* `ofono`, the telephony library, **mal** pushed his [work on 5G support](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/40) as a pull request.

* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, **pvuorela** [hided the symbols that were only privately used](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/13) by the library, gaining 50kB on the file in the process.

* `libgofono`, a glib-based wrapper for ofono D-Bus interfaces, **slava** [freshened up the MCC table](https://github.com/sailfishos/libgofono/commit/f0ea43cbf5513456ee8953fd0070c6d1e30abda5).

* `sailfish-log-viewer`, an application to fetch logs, **vigejolla** [updated the application with latest developments](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-log-viewer/pull/2) from **slava** (fixing linking and translation issues and adding the metadata for Chum).

## Browser stack

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **flypig** [binded `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` with the new colour scheme property](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/47).

* `gecko-dev`, the browser engine, **flypig** [linked the colour scheme to the `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` setting](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/149), so the ambience can influence the colour scheme.

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **flypig** fixed an [issue on height calculation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/162) with the help of **poetaster**.

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **flypig** added a new combo box in the setting page to [select the preferred colour scheme](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1007).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **pvuorela** is proposing to [fix a long-lasting legacy where mKCal is enforcing the organizer into the attendee list](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/36). **dcaliste** found [yet another case of alarm misbehaving for recurring events](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/38) when an exception is removed. **dcaliste** is also proposing to [evolve the plugin API](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/39), to avoid the usage of `::Ptr` and also to [ensure at database level that deleting a recurring event is also deleting its exceptions](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/40). Finally, **dcaliste** is currently working on an [asynchronous implementation of the database access](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/37). If successfull, it may replace the current asynchronous implementation in the QML bindings and unify the usage of `KCalendarCore::Incidence` from mKCal to the QML bindings.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **pvuorela**, following his [changes on mKCal on organiser storage](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/36), is proposing to simplify the serialisation to iCal format when uploading a new or a modified event to a server, by [removing the additionnal code always removig the organiser from the attendee list](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/12).

## Low-level libraries

* `findutils`, GNU find and xargs, **martyone** reworked patches to [avoid patching submodules](https://github.com/sailfishos/findutils/pull/2).

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** added an option for devices that does not emit change notification on `power_supply` (like charger disconnected), to [listen to the `extcon` subsystem](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/18).

* `openssl`, utilities and library for cryptography, **thaodan** [updated to 1.1.1s](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssl/pull/4) for security fixes and performence improvements.

* `signon-plugin-oauth2`, a plugin to handle OAuth2 protocol, **thaodan** patched the code to [avoid sending a PKCE challenge when the service already answered with a token](https://github.com/sailfishos/signon-plugin-oauth2/pull/4) and quickly [fixed the submodule pointer](https://github.com/sailfishos/signon-plugin-oauth2/pull/5).

* `qtbase`, the Qt library, **martyone** [removed support for old TLS 1.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtbase/pull/14) from the (old) Qt5.6 code base.

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **martyone** [fixed an issue in packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/13).

## SDK and development tools

* `git`, the famous version control, **martyone** got included his proposition to [backport the patch that restrains `--invert-grep` option to ``--grep`](https://github.com/sailfishos/git/pull/6) and not `--author` for instance.

* `sdk-setup`, part of the Sailfish SDK, **martyone** has [added a `scrape` command to `mb2`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/340) that allows to scrape modifications from sources and save them as patches. **martyone** also [renamed `git-change-log` into `sdfk-changelog`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/341) and updated `mb2` accordingly. He also added a patch to [fix the determination of the setup directory when it is in a sub-directory](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/342) and another one [not to look for a target when none is needed](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/343).

* `sailfish-qtcreator`, the Qt IDE, **martyone** [added the `changelog` command](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/545). He also lower the file limit under docker since some applications don't work well with the very high limit.

## Software engineering

* `sp-rich-core`, a tool to create core with many information, **pvuorela** [fixed the unit tests](https://github.com/sailfishos/sp-rich-core/pull/95).

* `gcc`, the GNU compiler collection, **mal** [regenerated the packages to use GCC as a cross compiler](https://github.com/sailfishos/gcc/pull/3) for various architectures supported by Sailfish OS.

* `python3`, the popular and widely used programming language, **mal** is working in a branch to [ensure reproducible builds](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3/tree/build-fix).

* `build-compare`, scripts to find out if the build result differs to a former build, **martyone** got in a patch to [remove the release from version and to ignore the version in Perl](https://github.com/sailfishos/build-compare/pull/5).
