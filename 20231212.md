# Repository roundup

With the administrative situation of Jolla sorted out, the activity in the public repositories of Sailfish OS increased significantly in the last 15 days. **pvuorela** took care of long standing pull requests, closing old ones and accepting many of the Qt6 upgrades from **neochapay** and **jmlich**. **mal** also continued his large work of keeping the software stack up-to-date and is also testing an upgrade of GCC, fixing in advance what will break in other packages.

## Communication services

* `libqofono`, Qt bindings for Ofono, **neochapay** updated [the build system for Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/14).

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **mariuszmaximus** proposed to [add a cmake build system](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/22) in parallel to the current qmake one.

* `libqofonoext`, Qt bindings for specific Sailfish OS extension to Ofono, **jmlich** proposed to [fix a broken value in an enumeration](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofonoext/pull/5), using a 64 bits value while the specifications is clear that enumerations are using plain integers.

* `bluez5`, the Bluetooth stack, **acfbhytuiltyghrth** partially [backported a fix](https://github.com/sailfishos/bluez5/pull/10) for the [two recent CVEs](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/cve-2023-45866-cve-2020-0556/17564). **mal** commented that a general update of Bluez should be preferable and may happen before the next Sailfish OS release.

* `commhistory-daemon`, the daemon handling call and message history, **pvuorela** changed the [reply method for SMS](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/9), switching to a inline text one.

## Multimedia

* `nemo-qml-plugin-thumbnailer`, the QML bindings to get image thumbnails, **jmlich** updated the build system to [support Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-thumbnailer/pull/5).

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **pvuorela** fixed a [race issue with the MCE plugin](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/9) in case of quick stop and restart.

* `libngf-qt`, Qt-based client library for Non-Graphic Feedback daemon, **pvuorela** ensured that [events passed to `ngfd` still exist](https://github.com/sailfishos/libngf-qt/pull/9).

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** introduced a [new hint](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/47) to be able to store the priviledge level of notifications.

## Low level libraries

* `nemo-qml-plugin-models`, provides QML models for searching or filtering, **jmlich** [adjusted the code for compilation with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-models/pull/5).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-configuration`, QML bindings to access configuration values, **neochapay** proposed changes to [get the package build with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-configuration/pull/4).

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **Herrie82** is working on making the [changes for LuneOS](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/21) accepted in SailfishOS. While these changes concerned newer versions of Qt, some also deal with how the package is built with libhybris. After some exchanges with **mal**, a [simpler solution](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/22) proposed by **Tofee** has been accepted.

* `mlite`, the configuration storage library, **pvuorela** allowed to [keep the priviledges of the calling process](https://github.com/sailfishos/mlite/pull/5) via D-Bus.

## Developper's corner

* **mal** is working on upgrading `gcc` to version 10. This implies to fix various new compilation issues:
  - [Use default copy assignment operator](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets/pull/190) for KeyResult in `sailfish-secrets` and also in [lipstick](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/46) and in [buteo-sync-plugins-social](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/10).
  - [Remove unnecessary copy constructor from Link](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1049) in `sailfish-browser`.
  - [Allow uninitialized global variables in a common block](https://github.com/sailfishos/dirmngr/pull/2) in `dirmngr` and also [in `gnupg2`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gnupg2/pull/3) and in [diffutils](https://github.com/sailfishos/diffutils/pull/1).
  - [Fix multiple definition of variable when using inet.h](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/50) in `connman`.

* `abseil-cpp`, a C++ library designed to augment the C++ standard library, **nephros** proposed to [update it](https://github.com/sailfishos/abseil-cpp/pull/2) as a dependency of [`protobuf` being itself required by various applications in Chum](https://github.com/sailfishos/protobuf/pull/3).

* `check`, a unit test framework for C, **mal** [updated it to 0.15.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/check/pull/1).
