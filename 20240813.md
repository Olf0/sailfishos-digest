# Repository roundup

Summer period, while calmer than the rest of the year in term of development, has been filled up with interesting changes. Next Sailfish OS version will see a modernized `connman`, better aligned with its upstream development. **flypig**, **rainemak** and other contributors are actively closing issues after issues for an upgrade of the browser to Gecko ESR 91. Changes to support new devices are also visible under the hood, like **mal**'s work to adapt to Android 14, **pvuorela** modifications to UI for devices with cutout display, or even low-level adjustments by **spiiroin** to abstract device specific behaviours.

## Communication bits

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** worked on a draft [introducing a plugin mechanism to handle credential passing](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/19) to e-mail protocols. It is largely based on an existing patch initially developped for Sailfish OS that requires some adjustments to be upstreamed.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **Laakkonenjussi** [upgraded it to 1.38](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/74) and also [fixed error handling](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/75) of WireGuard VPN.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity`, QML bindings for network connectivity, **LaakkonenJussi** added [support for WireGuard](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity/pull/12) (a VPN solution).

* `iproute`, advanced IP routing and network device configuration tools, **LaakkonenJussi** [updated it to 6.9.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/iproute/pull/4).

## Sailfish browser

* `embedlite-components`, QML components for the browser, **rainemak** [replaced deprecated calls](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/99) as required by **flypig**'s work on upgrading the browser to ESR 91.

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **rainemak** added a [new argument](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/168) for ESR 91 to the `createView()` method. **flypig** opened a pull request to [test the webview with ESR 91](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/169) and started discussing the required changes.

## Multimedia framework

* `qtgrilo`, a framework for discovering and browsing media, Qt bindings, **pvuorela** [fixed a crashing issue in the player application](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtgrilo/pull/5) when internally the query results have entries with duplicate ids.

## User interface

* `yamui`, minimal UI tool for displaying simple graphical indicators, **spiiroin** fixed a [race issue on D-Bus name ownership](https://github.com/sailfishos/yamui/pull/16) when a second `yamui` instance is supposed to replace a first one.

* `sailfish-office`, the document application, **pvuorela** [replaced system notifications with in-application ones](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-office/pull/195) to avoid issues for devices with a cutout on top of the display.

## Low level libraries

* `libmlocale`, localisation helpers from Meego touch, **mal** fixed [build issues with GCC 12](https://github.com/sailfishos/libmlocale/pull/5). There were bi-directional unicode characters in the source. To avoid ambiguities, **mal** entered them as `QChar` with their hexadecimal notations.

* `calligra`, office suite from KDE, **mal** backported a [code fix for an internal library](https://github.com/sailfishos/calligra/pull/3) used by Calligra (kcoreaddons), which was not compiling anymore with GCC 11.

* `cups`, the standards-based printing system, **mal** has [upgraded it to 2.4.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/cups/pull/6).

* `openssh`, the OpenSSH implementation of SSH protocol, **mal** [updated it to 9.8p1](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssh/pull/5).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager`, QML components to create a file manager, **abranson** [updated the paths used by AppSupport](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager/pull/9) when calculating its disk usage: `/home/.android` will become `/home/.appsupport` and the runtime will be in `/opt/appsupport` instead of `/opt/alien`.

* `libdrm`, a Direct Rendering Manager runtime library, **mal** [updated it to 2.4.122](https://github.com/sailfishos/libdrm/pull/3).

* `mesa`, graphic libraries, **mal** [updated them to 24.1.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/mesa/pull/4).

* `libmnl`, minimalistic Netlink user-space library, **LaakkonenJussi** [cleaned up the spec file](https://github.com/sailfishos/libmnl/pull/1) used to build the RPM packages.

* `libjpeg-turbo`, a fast encoding and decoding library for JPEG, **mal** [updated it to 3.0.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/libjpeg-turbo/pull/4).

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **mal** proposed a patch to [support Android 14 APIs](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/127).

* `poppler`, the PDF (rendering) library, **attah**'s work on [upgrading to the latest upstream version 24.08.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/poppler/pull/4) has been merged.

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **Thaodan** [fixed build with recent `libzypp`](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/20).

* `libresource`, the MeeGo resource management library, **sertonix** fixed [build issues with GCC 14](https://github.com/sailfishos/libresource/pull/3).

* `mce`, mode control entity, **sertonix** added [missing includes](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/29) reported by GCC 14 as errors. **spiiroin** proposed a different fix later on and also [ensured that POSIX version of `basename()` is working](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/31), for OS shipping non GNU `libc`, like MUSL `libc`. **spiiroin** also added support to [use numerical values (instead of named values) in evdev mapping](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/32).

* `buteo-syncfw`, the framework handling synchronisation, **dcaliste** [expanded the QML support](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/19), adding a SyncManager object that can talk to the synchronisation daemon. The idea is to provide necessary functions to UBPorts so they can simplify their [own declarative plugin](https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/core/buteo-syncfw-qml/-/merge_requests/4).

* `qmf-notifications-plugin`, a plugin to send notifications on email changes, **pvuorela** [cleaned up various parts](https://github.com/sailfishos/qmf-notifications-plugin/pull/4) of the code. **dcaliste** [dropped the inclusion of a header](https://github.com/sailfishos/qmf-notifications-plugin/pull/5) coming a patch to `messagingframework` to use direct calls to `libaccount-qt5`.

## Developer's corner

* `autoconf`, the infamous GNU build system - automatic system detection, **mal** [upgraded it to 2.72](https://github.com/sailfishos/autoconf/pull/3) (from 2.71).

* `make`, a tool to simplify builds, **mal** has been working on an [update to version 4.4.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/make/tree/test). Upgrading `make` requires though to adjust some other projects:
 - [`farstream`](https://github.com/sailfishos/farstream/pull/1),

* `sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator`, the harbour validation scripts, **vige** [replaced deprecated `egrep` with `grep -E`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/176).

* `util-linux`, a collection of basic system utilities, **mal** [added missing symlinks](https://github.com/sailfishos/util-linux/pull/10) on swap tools, as required by `systemd`.

* `android-tools`, the Android tools, **Thaodan** [changed the packaging of the Android tools](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools/pull/2), for it to be based on the NDK tools, as it is already done by some other distributions.

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, now that `android-tools` is based on NDK tools, **Thaodan** [removed them from the HADK packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/10). He also ensured in `mer-android-chroot` script that [all mount points are unmounted on exit](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/9).
