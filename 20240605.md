* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS / phone history, **pvuorela** [corrected the wrong usage of a service name](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/14) instead of an interface one in DBus listeners.

## Multimedia framework

* `gstreamer`, a multimedia framework, **mal** [upgraded to the latest upstream version 1.24.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/gstreamer/pull/7). The various plugins were also upgraded accordingly.

## User interface

* `sailfish-utilities`, the setting page to restart failing services, **rainemak** added an action to [restart the audio stack](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-utilities/pull/67) in case it is stuck.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, **dcaliste** is proposing a [fix for lagging issues on event viewing in the calendar application](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/64) when the event database is slow to be loaded.

## Low level libraries

* `wayland`, Wayland compositor, **mal** [updated it to 1.22.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/wayland/pull/2).

* `wayland-protocols`, Wayland protocols that adds functionality not available in the core protocol, **mal** [updated them to 1.36](https://github.com/sailfishos/wayland-protocols/pull/2).

* `mce`, mode control entity, **piggz** [proposed to emulate a double tap](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/28) (user interaction) when the modem emits a `KEY_WAKEUP` event. **spiiroin** argued that it may not be wise to simulate a user event from a device event. He proposed instead to quit suspend state when the modem emit the event, so a user action can later on wake up the display.

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, now that `libnfcdef` is in the repositories [**slava**'s work](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/17) has been merged in.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-contacts`, QML bindings to access the contact database, **sunweaver** is working on [adding a GSettings backend](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-contacts/pull/13), besides the existing one using MLite.

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **keto** [proposed to add the ssu domain](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/17) into the repository properties.

* `gzip`, the compression tool and library, **mal** [updated it to 1.13](https://github.com/sailfishos/gzip/pull/1).

## Developer's corner

* `buteo-sync-plugins-social`, several sync plugins for Google, Facebook and other proprietary protocols, as for the CalDAV plugin, **pvuorela** [cleaned up the installation scripts](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/14) to avoid unnecessary service restarts since the plugin processes are now out-of-process.

* `meego-rpm-config`, specific rpm configuration files for Sailfish OS, **mal** [switched python bytecode compilation step](https://github.com/sailfishos/meego-rpm-config/pull/7) to use Python 3.

* `qt-installer-framework`, base for the SDK installer, **martyone** [fixed an issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/qt-installer-framework/pull/16) with archive sizes not being reported properly.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-contacts`, QML bindings to access the contact database, **sunweaver** [fixed a build issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-contacts/pull/12) because of missing QtDBus dependency. An option [to compile without `mce`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-contacts/pull/14) was also added. `mce` is used to know if the bindings are used in a GUI application or not and to react on display state changes.
