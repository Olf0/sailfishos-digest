# Repository roundup


## The network stack

* `connectionagent`, a daemon and QML bindings to connect to ConnMan, **abranson** modified the DBus interface so [Wifi tethering and Bluetooth tethering can be manipulated separately](https://github.com/sailfishos/connectionagent/pull/3). Previous, the tethering API was implicitely dealing with Wifi thethering only. The pull request has not been accepted yet.

* `ssu-sysinfo`, tools and libraries for getting ssu information, **abranson** proposed a patch [exposing Bluetooth thethering hardware feature](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu-sysinfo/pull/3).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, a QML component used by the Settings app, **abranson** proposed a patch to [expose Bluetooth thethering hardware feature](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/35).

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [reversed the commit adding longer timeout to establish connection](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/42). It seems that it's not solving the problem.

## The telephony stack

* `voicecall`, the open source part of the calling application, **Michal-Szczepaniak** proposed to [package again the header files](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/11), so plugins can be compiled against `voicecall`.

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** cleaned [internal class not to use `QSharedPointer`](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/56) when not necessary. **dcaliste** also [modified the API of the purge function to restrict it to a given notebook](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/59). He is working on the deprecation of notebook support from `KCalendarCore::Calendar` in KDE, with two pull requests, one [separating the SQLite operation from the memory operations](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/60) and another one [implementating new storage classes](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/61).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, **dcaliste** [restricted the event purging from database to the correct notebook](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/51). This is a required step to support incidences with the same UID in different notebooks, allowing then to be able to move events between notebooks.

* `buteo-sync-plugins-social`, several sync plugins for Google, Facebook and other proprietary protocols, **dcaliste** [restricted here also the event purging](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/9).

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **dcaliste**  [restricted here also the event purging](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/21). **dcaliste** also opened a pull-request [demonstrating the use of a single notebook storage](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/22), as newly introduced in mKCal.

## Low level libraries

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **lgtrombetta** proposed to [fix calibration issues of the magnetometer](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/8). The patch has been tested on the PinePhone and is proposed by the Ubuntu touch community.

* `libxml2`, an XML parsing library, **mal** [updated it to 2.10.4](https://github.com/sailfishos/libxml2/pull/3) fixing two CVEs.

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **mal** has started working on [porting to Android 13](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/tree/android13).

* `libngf-qt`, Qt-based client library for Non-Graphic Feedback daemon, **pvuorela** set up a [different feedback for non-touch haptics](https://github.com/sailfishos/libngf-qt/pull/7) (to dissociate them from display ouch events). He also [silenced play failed signals](https://github.com/sailfishos/libngf-qt/pull/8), since they can come from just the haptic feedback being turned off.

* `libmce-glib`, Glib client for mce, **spiiroin** added [support for `MceInactivity`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libmce-glib/pull/1) which expose device inactivity. The pull request also contains a commit adding a example program on how to use the Glib bindings to Mce.

* `sailjail`, a wrapper around firejail, **vigejolla** added a [missing build dependency](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail/pull/77).

## SDK and developer tools

* `amber-web-authorization`, a QML module allowing applications to perform OAuth1 and OAuth2 requests, **vigejolla** [migrated its documentation](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-web-authorization/pull/8) to use Sailfish template instead of Mer one.

* `sdk-user-manual`, examples and documentation for the SDK, **vigejolla** also [migrated the documentation of this package](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-user-manual/pull/13).

* `sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator`, the harbour validation scripts, **vigejolla** [made the validation fails](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/174) when there are triggers in the generated RPM. He also [strictened the dependencies between packages](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-harbour-rpmvalidator/pull/175), banning `Conflicts`, `Recommends`, `Suggests`, `Supplements` and `Enhances` in addition to already forbidden usage of `Obsoletes`.

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, **vigejolla** added [a sentence explaining the `Privileged` permission](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/139) and [restricted it for internal purposes](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/140) only.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-notifications`, QML bindings to the Freedesktop notification system, **vigejolla** fixed the [links to the specification](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-notifications/pull/7) in the documentation.
