Repository activities from 2022-03-31 to 2022-04-15
---------------------------------------------------

### Network access

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, daniellinjama proposed [to add `/var/run` in allowed directories](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/121) since `connman` is using it to redirect `resolv.conf`, see https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/10829. But after discussion, it appeared that it would be a security break since all subdirs of `/var/run` would then have been visible. Instead, spiiroin suggested to use a subdir of `/run` instead. Which leaded daniellinjama to propose a patch in `connman` itself.
* `connman`, the connection manager, daniellinjama contributed an improvement [droping hardcoded `/var/run` in favour of build option `runstatedir=/run`](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/26). LaakkonenJussi has submitted a pull request for [the wifi regulatory domain to be based on the time zone of the device](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/27), either coming from the telephony stack or chosen by the user. LaakkonenJussi backported three patches fixing issues with [ethernet not having proper MAC address set](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/28). 

### User interface

* `maliit-framework`, the code handling the keyboard, pvuorela [updated from old 0.9 version to 2.2.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/maliit-framework/pull/3), moving also the repository to a cleaner submodule with patches.

### QML

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to access system parameters, neochapay has continued his work on [making the bindings independant of packagekit](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/2) for systems where the developper mode is not used.
* `qtdeclarative`, Qt implementation of QML language, a pull request started in late February was accepted. It is based on backports [allowing JIT for aarch64 architectures](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtdeclarative/pull/4). JIT means "just in time" and is used to compile on the fly script language like QML. It can brings significantly improved exceution time, depending on code.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-thumbnailer`, the QML bindings to get image thumbnails, pvuorela [improved resource consumption](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-thumbnailer/pull/4) by starting the worker thread only when necessary and not at object creation.

### Bluetooth

* `bluez5`, the code handling Bluetooth in Linux, piggz backported a fix he contributed upstream so [the appearence of the Bluetooth device can only be read one](https://github.com/sailfishos/bluez5/pull/6). This is mitigating a firmware issue on GTR2 watches.

### The web browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, flypig fixed some rendering issues where [radio and checkbox were not allowed to expand as requested](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/147). See his comment where he provided a [before and after screenshot](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/147#issuecomment-1087176903) and a bit of explanations. The pull request on [backporting the patches for ELF format reduction on aarch64 architecture](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/146) was accepted.

### Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, dcaliste submitted a pull request [removing some unused code and also ensuring that only a unique default exists in the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/29).


### Hardware adaptation

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, the discussions on thaodan's pull request [cleaning and fixing issues in the `mer-android-chroot` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/7) continued, improving the initial proposition. lotheac proposed also a patch to this same `mer-android-chroot` script [to avoid getting spammed by the message `sudo: unable to resolve host ...`](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/8).

### SDK / documentation

 - a [new dedicated paragraph in the cheat sheet page to repository handling](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/62) by rainemak,
 - correct hardware adaptation build instructions to [use the correct hardware family models](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/58) by thaodan,
 - update the SDK page for [the 3.9 release](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/63) by martyone.

* `quillmetadata`, a Nemo project providing Qt bindings to EXIF data, pvuorela arranged [the tests to be installed in `/opt`](https://github.com/sailfishos/quillmetadata/pull/1), abandoning original version numbering in the process ; ) (https://github.com/sailfishos/quillmetadata/pull/1/files#diff-a11fc7857e1a5092ca3bd3f9457dc0116f8af2e41188eea5d96722c70e5c9425L3).
