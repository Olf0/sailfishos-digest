---------------------------------------------------

### Network

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, daniellinjama proposed [to add `/var/run` in allowed directories](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/121) since `connman` is using it to redirect `resolv.conf`, see https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/10829. But after discussion, it appeared that it would be a security break since all subdirs of `/var/run` would then have been visible. Instead, spiiroin suggested to use a subdir of `/run` instead. Which leaded daniellinjama to propose a patch in `connman` itself.
* `connman`, the connection manager, daniellinjama contributed an improvement [droping hardcoded `/var/run` in favour of build option `runstatedir=/run`](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/26). LaakkonenJussi has submitted a pull request for [the wifi regulatory domain to be based on the time zone of the device](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/27), either coming from the telephony stack or chosen by the user. LaakkonenJussi backported three patches fixing issues with [ethernet not having proper MAC address set](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/28).

### Telephony stack

* `mms-engine`, the framework to send and receive MMS, mlehtima in his work to update Glib2 package [fixed a compilation issue introduced by the switch to Glib 2.72](https://github.com/sailfishos/mms-engine/pull/4).
* `telepathy-qt`, the Qt bindings for the Telepathy framework, mlehtima fixed also a [compilation issue there when moving to Glib 2.72](https://github.com/sailfishos/telepathy-qt/pull/2).

### User interface

* `maliit-framework`, the code handling the keyboard, pvuorela [updated from old 0.9 version to 2.2.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/maliit-framework/pull/3), moving also the repository to a cleaner submodule with patches.
* `mce`, a framework exposing hardware status of display, buttonsâ€¦, spiiroin is proposing a change in [display brightness handling for devices with specific high brightness modes](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/11) coded in the brightness sysfs file.
* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, thaodan is proposing a pull request [improving the documentation for the "custom" sound effect](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/6), as supported or not by the hardware.

### Positioning

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, rainemak [added the sensor permission to the location one](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/122), so harbour applications using the GPS can get access also to the compass. It was Jolla bug #58000 ;), reported by direc85.

### QML

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to access system parameters, neochapay has continued his work on [making the bindings independant of packagekit](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/2) for systems where the developper mode is not used.
* `qtdeclarative`, Qt implementation of QML language, a pull request started in late February was accepted. It is based on backports [allowing JIT for aarch64 architectures](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtdeclarative/pull/4). JIT means "just in time" and is used to compile on the fly script language like QML. It can brings significantly improved exceution time, depending on code.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-thumbnailer`, the QML bindings to get image thumbnails, pvuorela [improved resource consumption](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-thumbnailer/pull/4) by starting the worker thread only when necessary and not at object creation.

### Bluetooth

* `bluez5`, the code handling Bluetooth in Linux, piggz backported a fix he contributed upstream so [the appearence of the Bluetooth device can only be read one](https://github.com/sailfishos/bluez5/pull/6). This is mitigating a firmware issue on GTR2 watches.

### Web browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, flypig fixed some rendering issues where [radio and checkbox were not allowed to expand as requested](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/147). See his comment where he provided a [before and after screenshot](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/147#issuecomment-1087176903) and a bit of explanations. The pull request on [backporting the patches for ELF format reduction on aarch64 architecture](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/146) was accepted.
* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, rainemak ensured that [the overlay is not shown if the view has already an URL set](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/996). He is also proposing to [fake Google pages with a Firefox user-agent string instead of one advertising SailfishBrowser](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/997). This would allow to get Google to use a mobile layout. This is addressing a Jolla bug as old as 26304 (current numbering is around 58000). The fix may not have been applied earlier because the Gecko engine was still too old for Google layouting of its pages with a Firefox user-agent (personal guess) before the latest 4.4.0 release bringing the Gecko 78 engine.

### Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, dcaliste [removed some unused code and also ensured that only a unique default exists in the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/29). As suggested by pvuorela, he is also proposing a pull request to [remove the internal usage of `Notebook::Ptr` inside mKCal and proposes to also deprecate it completely from the public API](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/30).
* `kf5-calendarcore`, the KDE framework library to handle calendar data, dcaliste update the package to [latest version 5.93.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/kf5-calendarcore/pull/12).
* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, dcaliste [replaced the `Notebook::isDefault()` call in the worker thread](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/36) with an equivalent using the `ExtendedStorage` API only, allowing to later on remove the default exposure from Notebook API.

### Low level libraries

* `glib2`, the Glib library from GTK / Gnome, mlehtima is proposing to [update from 2.66.2 (from October 2020) to 2.72.0 (from 3 weeks ago)](https://github.com/sailfishos/glib2/pull/2).
* `qtbase`, the Qt library, pvuorela fixed a [potential endless loop in the connection state](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtbase/pull/8) from QNetworkAccessManager.

### Hardware adaptation

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, the discussions on thaodan's pull request [cleaning and fixing issues in the `mer-android-chroot` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/7) continued, improving the initial proposition. lotheac proposed also a patch to this same `mer-android-chroot` script [to avoid getting spammed by the message `sudo: unable to resolve host ...`](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/8).

### SDK / documentation

* `docs.sailfishos.org`, website sources, various changes in the documentation were accepted:
 - [use `HTTPS://` links for github, instead of `GIT://`](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/61) from voidanix,
 - a [new dedicated paragraph in the cheat sheet page to repository handling](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/62) by rainemak,
 - correct hardware adaptation build instructions to [use the correct hardware family models](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/58) by thaodan,
 - update the SDK page for [the 3.9 release](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/63) by martyone.
 - a contribution from pherjung to [correct a mistake in code sample from the Python tutorial](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/55)
And some other proposed and still under review:
 - a [up-to-date way to export contacts](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/64) as VCards by nephros.

### Quality / software engineering

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), spiiroin has proposed three patches to [fix failing tests](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/22). Then mlehtima hot-fixed a [misplaced RPM dependency for the test package](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/23) introduced with the previous PR.
* `quillmetadata`, a Nemo project providing Qt bindings to EXIF data, pvuorela arranged [the tests to be installed in `/opt`](https://github.com/sailfishos/quillmetadata/pull/1), abandoning original version numbering in the process ; ) (https://github.com/sailfishos/quillmetadata/pull/1/files#diff-a11fc7857e1a5092ca3bd3f9457dc0116f8af2e41188eea5d96722c70e5c9425L3).
* `flex`, a free implementation of the lexical analyser `lex`, thaodan fixed a [missing library at link stage for the tests](https://github.com/sailfishos/flex/pull/1).
