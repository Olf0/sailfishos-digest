# Repository roundup

The summer period was a period of vacation for many people, but not for all. The large number of package upgrades done by **mal**, **attah** and **Thaodan** or the work to port to Qt6 many key components done by **neochapay** and **jmlich**, show that Sailfish OS is actually a (Linux) distribution. Which means that it is leveraging capabilities from many upstream projects, which also come with a maintainance cost. This work of updating all the packages can be seen as a work not spent on adding new features visible to the user, but it is essential to fix bugs, keep pace with upstream evolutions... Besides, an element raised my interest from its pull request title: "Add support for Android 13.", done by **mal** in `droidmedia` repository.

## The network stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** merged his work on [adding VPN support with CLAT](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/41) and proposed [three follow-up](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/47) [pull requests](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/48) [cleaning minor issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/49) after the large changes introduced by the CLAT + VPN work. **LaakkonenJussi** also [fixed a compilation warning on 64bits architectures](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/45). Finally, **LaakkonenJussi** proposed to [emit a change signal also when default service is changed](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/46), so higher layers can properly interpret it.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** is working on [completely moving route parsing into ConnMan](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/19). **neochapay** proposed to modify the build system to [allow concurrent installation with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/20).

## Telephony stack

* `libqofonoext`, Qt bindings for specific Sailfish OS extension to Ofono, **jmlich** updated the build system for [Qt6 concurrent installation](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofonoext/pull/4).

## Document and files

* `poppler`, the PDF rendering library, **attah** [updated it to version 23.07.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/poppler/pull/3).

## Mapping and location services

* `qtlocation`, Qt modules to handle positioning and location, **poetaster** [updated the URLs for tile services](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtlocation/pull/2/files), making the QML map widgets working again.

## Communication services

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **dcaliste** proposed to [expose to QML the encryption status of a message](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/8). He also proposed some [code simplification in attachment handling](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/9).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** has proposed to [move the alarm handling code in a new class](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/65), so ExtendedStorage can become deprecated one day.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste** proposed to [change the importation internal logic](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/59) to properly handle cases where events sharing the same UID can be in different notebooks.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **dcaliste** found an issue when [importing an event containing '/' characters in its UID](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/25).

## Browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **attah** proposition to [enable the dialog element](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/156), since this element is now standard and available since Firefox 53, has now been merged.

* `gmp-droid`, a Gecko Media Plugin to enable use of Android hardware codecs through droidmedia on libhybris-based devices, **rainemak** continued the work of **d-grigorev** ensuring that the [video encoder is producing a constant bitrate stream](https://github.com/sailfishos/gmp-droid/pull/22), not to conflict with WebRTC bandwidth limiting algorithms.

* `gecko-camera`, a plugin-based library for Gecko to simplify video capture, **rainemak** and **d-grigorev** [propagates recent changes from `gmp-droid`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-camera/pull/11) on constant bitrate for video capture.
