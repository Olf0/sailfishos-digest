# Repository roundup

A element raised interest from the pull request title: "Add support for Android 13.", done by **mal** in `droidmedia` repository.

## The network stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** merged his work on [adding VPN support with CLAT](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/41) and proposed a follow-up pull request [cleaning minor issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/47) after the large changes introduced by the CLAT + VPN work. **LaakkonenJussi** also [fixed a compilation warning on 64bits architectures](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/45). Finally, **LaakkonenJussi** proposed to [emit a change signal also when default service is changed](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/46), so higher layers can properly interpret it.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** is working on [completely moving route parsing into ConnMan](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/19). 

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** has proposed to [move the alarm handling code in a new class](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/65), so ExtendedStorage can become deprecated one day.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste** proposed to [change the importation internal logic](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/59) to properly handle cases where events sharing the same UID can be in different notebooks.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **dcaliste** found an issue when [importing an event containing '/' characters in its UID](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/25).

## Browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **attah** proposition to [enable the dialog element](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/155), since this element is now standard and available since Firefox 53, has now been merged.

## User interface

* `sailfish-utilities`, the setting page to restart failing services, **ichthyosaurus** proposed to readd [a restart section for the keyboard](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-utilities/pull/66). Before, he added a [scrollbar to this setting page](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-utilities/pull/65).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-notifications`, QML bindings to the Freedesktop notification system, **pvuorela** is reworking [how the kind of action associated to a notification is passed to Lipstick](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-notifications/pull/9). The input case is now generically handled by an "input" type.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** proposed to [add a text property to the action associated to a notification](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/41).

## Audio and video layer

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **mal** has provided [support for Android 13](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/110).

## Low level libraries

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **sunweaver** has proposed a [fix in the build system](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/14). His solution is still debated.

* `libsdl`, a multimedia library, **mal** has proposed to [upgrade it and it's associated projects to 2.28.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/pull/4).

* `cups`, the standards-based printing system, **mal** has [upgraded it to 2.4.6](https://github.com/sailfishos/cups/pull/4).

## SDK and developer tools

* `sample-app-cppqml`, an example of code linking C++ and QML, **rainemak** [cleanup sources](https://github.com/sailfishos/sample-app-cppqml/pull/4), applying coding rules on style.
