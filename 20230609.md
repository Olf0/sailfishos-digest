# Repository roundup

Concerning these recent changes, there are two commits that catched my attention: two sailors made modifications in repositories (where Sailfish OS is upstream) to allow compilation with Qt6. Is it some personal initiative or a signal that finally a Qt upgrade may be sooner than later ? Future will tell, but this is the first time that such modifications are done by sailors. Up to now, they have always come from community members using the code in a different context (Nemo mobile, LuneOSâ€¦).

## The network stack

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **rferrazz** fixed an issue when [including headers](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/18), preventing VpnModel class to build under certain circumstances.

* `qtdeclarative`, Qt implementation of QML language, **szopin** proposed to be able to [use the `USER-AGENT` header in an XMLHttpRequest](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtdeclarative/pull/9), since it's now allowed by the spec and allowed by Qt since 2020.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **Laakkonenjussi** [fixed an inconsistentcy between reported device power state and technology (like Wifi) power state](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/43/files). This resulted sometimes in Wifi reporting no networks. **Laakkonenjussi** also fixed issues arising from [invalid country codes coming from the time zone data base](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/44).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** commited several minor changes cleaning and [allowing multi-notebook for events sharing the same UID](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/63). He also proposed [not to emit a reset signal on a notebook change](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/64), but instead let the client code handle the refresh.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **dcaliste** fixed a sync issue when [adding an exception to a recurring event that was created on another device](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/23). **dcaliste** also implemented a way to [retrieve allowed components in a calendar](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/24).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste** modified the calendar listing to [restrict it to those allowing events](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/57) (calendar like Nextcloud Tasks will not be visible anymore in the calendar application). He also worked on a large simplification, [dropping the `recurrenceId` argument](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/54) in favour of a global unique identifier. This work is breaking the calendar QML API for functions like `deleteEvent()`. The DBus API is still preserved though. Finally, he proposed to [avoid to do a complete memory reset on calendar changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/58).

## Browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **attah** proposed to [enable the dialog element](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/155), since this element is now standard and available since Firefox 53.

## Audio and video layer

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **rainemak** [got and completed the work started a while ago by **d-grigorev**](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/108) to make the starting of MediaCodec asynchronous. This may help to gain 12 to 14 frames on camera start-up for instance. He completed it with a fix to [allow to keep compilation working](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/109) for Android before version 7.

* `gmp-droid`, a Gecko Media Plugin to enable use of Android hardware codecs through droidmedia on libhybris-based devices, **rainemak** continued the work of **d-grigorev** ensuring that the [video encoder is producing a constant bitrate stream](https://github.com/sailfishos/gmp-droid/pull/22), not to conflict with WebRTC bandwidth limiting algorithms.

* `gecko-camera`, a plugin-based library for Gecko to simplify video capture, **rainemak** and **d-grigorev** [propagates recent changes from `gmp-droid`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-camera/pull/11) on constant bitrate for video capture.

* `amber-mrpis`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **Tomin1** [fixed build with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/24).

## Low level libraries

* `libglibutil`, a library extending GLib with convenient utilities, **slava** added [methods to deal with arrays of GOject references](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/commit/70ac525340f488e89ffb65b4eddf43928021c04a).

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **slava** [added a new class](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/7) to avoid allocating unnecessary GBytes objects and reduce data copying in Listen mode.

* `usb-moded`, the USB tracking daemon, **piggz** adjusted the [USB device controller enumeration](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/13) to handle properly the Volla X23 model, where there are two such controllers (but one dummy).

* `yamui`, minimal UI tool for displaying simple graphical indicators, **Laakkonenjussi** [renamed the `debug` option into `skip-cleanup`](https://github.com/sailfishos/yamui/pull/14).

* `libiodata`, a library for writing and reading structured data, **pvuorela** [beautified the code with clang-format](https://github.com/sailfishos/libiodata/pull/4).

* `timed`, time and alarm handling daemon, **pvuorela** fixed an issue raised by **Laakkonenjussi** while working on regulatory domain adjustments. The code is [now comparing paths instead of inodes](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/7) (for symlinks, the inode stay the same while the target may change). He also [ran clang-format on the code base](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/8).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-models`, provides QML models for searching or filtering, **jmlich** [updated the code to compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-models/pull/4).

* `libnl`, a convenience library for kernel netlink sockets, **pvuorela** [updated it to 3.7.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/libnl/pull/4).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-notifications`, QML bindings to the Freedesktop notification system, **mkosola** [fixed build with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-notifications/pull/8).

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **lgtrombetta** [fixed calibration issues of the magnetometer](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/8). The patch has been tested on the PinePhone and is proposed by the Ubuntu touch community.

## SDK and developer tools

* `busybox`, a single binary which includes versions of a large number of system commands, **mal** [updated it to 1.36.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/busybox/pull/6).
