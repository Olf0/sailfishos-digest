# App roundup

## Flood To Java

Flood to Java from Thilo Kogge (**thigg**) has taken a while to make it into the Jolla Store (through no fault of thigg) since we [covered it's development](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/sailfish-community-news-25th-august-coffee/12785/2#java-on-sailfish-os-5 ) in August. I'm really pleased that it's now finally available for everyone to try out, including some nice improvements since we last talked about it.

The app itself is a simple but relaxing game about filling the square board with blocks of the same colour. At each turn you &mdash; the intrepid player &mdash; selects one of the colours from up to four available. The top left hand block changes to that colour, as do all of the blocks that were the same colour as it before the change. This way the colour "floods" out from the corner, picking up any touching blocks of the same colour as it goes.

Each step the flood of colours gets a little larger, until eventually the entire board is a single colour, which signals the end of the game.

Your score increases by the *square* of the number of blocks you convert at each step. So convert just one to score 1, convert two to score 4, three to score 9 and so on. If you're able to tactically line up a large flood in a single move, you'll be into the big scores.

If you just want to enjoy the app is a game then that's great, but personally I also gain gratification from knowing that it's a Java app that's nevertheless been compiled for use on Sailfish OS without the need to run it in the JVM. It's very neat technology.

The latest version includes a very nice competitive two-player mode, with players sitting on different sides of the phone and taking it in turns to select a colour.

The initial version 0.1 release is available in both the Jolla Store and on [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/thigg/flood-java ).

## OSM Scout

OSM Scout from Lukas Karas (**karry**) is a very capable native mapping app for Sailfish OS that allows both online and offline map navigation. As the initials of the app imply, it makes use of OpenStreetMap which might be considered the mapping equivalent of Wikipedia, since it collects mapping and location info through community croud-sourcing.

The results from both the maps and the app are excellent. Scrolling is smooth, the interface is clean (it helpfully keeps out of the way most of the time, so most of what you see is the map). Searching can be done by either placename or through one of the 18 pre-selected categories (e.g. "Cafe" or "Charging station"), each with their own very neat icons.

Offline routing works incredibly well, with travel by car, bike or on foot all as available options. The elevation profile is especially nice if you're planning to cycle.

It's very hard to do justice to an app like OSM Scout in such a short space, it has such a breadth of excellent features. Sailfish OS is blessed with a number of excellent native mapping apps, and this is definitely one that you should consider, especially (but not uniquely) if you're a cyclist or want to track your journeys.

The latest update brings OSM Scout to version 2.25, which improves tracking and online rendering amongst other things. It's available from the Jolla Store, [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/karry/osm-scout) and [Chum](https://build.merproject.org/package/show/sailfishos:chum/harbour-osmscout ).

## Молитвослов (Prayer Book)

Prayer Book from **zuyev** offers an Orthodox Christian prayer book and calendar, with support for Russian, English and Bulgarian. Select one doesn't just update the user interface to work with the chosen language, but also the prayers that are offered.

Although I don't have the religious knowledge to pass judgement on the prayers themselves, I'll happily do this for the app design. And what strikes me is the very careful attention to detail and clear passion that **zuyev** puts into its development. Prayers are clearly formatted, often contain illustrative images, and are also very carefully categorised. On top of that, it's also one of the most frequently updated apps that we've covered in the newsletter. All in all, it's a very impressive app that will no doubt be of benefit to anyone who follows the Orthodox Christian faith.

The app has now reached version 5.4.6 with the last few updates having added various prayers and items to the religious calendar, such as the lives of saints. It's available from both the Jolla Store and [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/zuyev/molitvoslov-prayer-book ).

## Yatzy

Like Flood to Java, Yatzy from **rgrnetalk** is a one- or two-player turn-based game that mixes strategy with chance.

The player rolls the five dice by hitting the appropriately named "Roll" button. A nice animation ensures, but as soon as the dice have settled you have to engage your brain. The user can choose to "spend" the dice in their roll to complete one of the 16 poker-like formations: three of a kind, four of a kind, straight, house, *etc.* Each formation can only be used once, and the score you receive each time is made from the sum of the dice that make up the formation. So try to make your "Three of a kind" out of sixes and not ones if you want the big scores.

Each turn you get to roll the dice three times (you can select just a subset of the dice to roll), after which you're forced to choose. There are real choices to be made: are you going to select the middle-scoring pair of threes, or throw again and risk having to assign a score of zero to one of the entries.

The latest version fixes a bug that allowed you to roll the dice even if they were all held, but note that performing the update will also clear all of the high scores.

The latest version 0.7-3 is available only from the Jolla Store, and is a great app, especially if you have a super-competitive opponent to play against!
