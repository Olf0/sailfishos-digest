# Repository roundup

## Multimedia stack

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **b100dian** is working on [allowing edge-mode and noise reduction](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/122) with the Camera 2 API. He noticed that the parameters received from `gst-droid` were sent while no image was ready and resent later with some missing parameters. **simonschmeisser** found another [failling string to real conversion](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/123) due to locale dependant code. He proposed to [create a `README`](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/124) file to explain how to build and develop the package, and also to [standardise the formatting of the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/126) (and ensure it at commits) using Clang formatter.

* `gst-droid`, plugin for GStreamer allowing to use hardware accelerated codecs, **simonschmeisser** proposed to [use a real value instead of an integer](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-droid/pull/80) to be sent to the droid camera code.

* `libsdl`, a multimedia library, **mal** replaced [a patch with the upstream fix](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/pull/6).

## Communication bits

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **dcaliste** [fixed a bug creating duplicated files](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/18) on attachment download. The change also allows to save the attachments directly in `~/Downloads/` instead of putting them in a complex tree structure.

* `mobile-broadband-provider-info`, the database of access point configurations, **ruditimmermans** [corrected the APN of Orange network in Belgium](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/19). He also proposed to [correct the MNC and the APN for Mobile Vikings](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/21) in Belgium.

* `kf5bluezqt`, the KDE framework handling Bluetooth, **pvuorela** [removed two patches](https://github.com/sailfishos/kf5bluezqt/pull/9) creating locking issues on Xperia 1 II for instance. The patches were introduced earlier to fix an issue with file transfer but it seems that they are not needed anymore and were now creating more harm than solving issue.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [removed non usefull debug messages](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/23) and proposed to [update the default route](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/25) only when there are some changes in the service cache. **iceaway** proposed to [implement the `MoveBefore` / `MoveAfter` methods](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/24).

## Low level libraries

* `usb-moded`, the USB tracking daemon, **jmlich** [noticed some issue with the DBus interface](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/14) and after discussing possible solutions with **mal**, **Thaodan**, **spiiroin** and **pvuorela**, annotations of out parameters were changed to use `org.qtproject.QtDBus.QtTypeName.OutX` instead of `org.qtproject.QtDBus.QtTypeName.InX`. Then, **spiiroin** [regenerated the XML configuration files](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/15).

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** modified the hybris adaptor to [use pipes and io-watch for transferring sensor events](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/24) from worker thread to mainloop context. It can prevent crashes happening when the worker thread is touching concurrently code from the main loop. This pull request also contains changes from **mal** to support Android sensor device API 1.0 in the hybris adaptor.

## Developper's corner

* `libglibutil`, a library extending GLib with convenient utilities, **slava** [added a function, `gutil_idle_pool_get_default()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/12), making usage of `GUtilIdlePool` simpler in multi-threaded environments. **slava** also modified this class with [two commits](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/13), one treating NULL parameter as the default pool and another returning the value as pushed to the pool.

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **Thaodan** fixed an invocation of `ldconfig` in `sb2` command where the [path for the cache was erroneously prefixed](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/28) with the root directory substitution.

* `libcontentaction`, a library for associating content with actions, **pvuorela** [fixed a unit test failing](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcontentaction/pull/6) since `shared-mime-info` capitalised its strings.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager`, QML bindings for file management, **pvuorela** [fixed a unit test failing](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager/pull/6) because `shared-mime-info` renamed `application/x-bzip` to `application/x-bzip2`.

* `osc`, the command line interface to work with OBS (the Open Build Service), **nephros** proposed to [use busybox compatible commands for completion](https://github.com/sailfishos/osc/pull/3). Following **Thaodan**'s advice, he also proposed it [to openSUSE](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/pull/1487).
