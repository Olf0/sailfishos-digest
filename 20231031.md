# Repository roundup

Few activity this last forenight, mainly driven by community members. It is not reported in this digest, but looking at the exchange in the various pull requests, Jolla is still actively working on review tasks and still accepting the changes when ready.

## Communication services

* `voicecall`, the open source part of the calling application, **neochapay** proposed modifications to allow [building it using Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/13).

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **tehnick** [removed `libdbusaccess` from the link](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/15) since it is not necessary and was creating an arbitrary dependency on this library.

## Multimedia

* `qtdocgallery`, Qt module to create a gallery, **neochapay** worked on a patch to [build the module over Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtdocgallery/pull/6).

## Audio and video layer

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **Tofee** fixed a build issue for the Yocto distribution when using meta-qt6. Because of wrongly set macro variable, [`sensorfw` was looking for modules in at the wrong path](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/20).

## Developper's corner

* `rust`, the Rust programming language compiler, **rubdos** is working on [upgrading the Rust package to version 1.73.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/rust/pull/21). Current patches for SailfishOS requires to be rebased and sometimes reworked on.
