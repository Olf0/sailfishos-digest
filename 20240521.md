# Repository roundup

## Communication bits

* `voicecall`, the open source part of the calling application, **dcaliste** proposed to [add a `filter()` function](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/15) so plug-ins can implement silencing an incoming call, or hang it up automatically. This API change is still under discussion.

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** updated from [upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/16), bringing an API for email decryption.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **dcaliste** added [support to read encrypted emails](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/21).

* `libsocialcache`, a library and a QML plugin that is used to manage cache from social networks, **pvuorela** proposed to [add support for PNG files](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsocialcache/pull/3) (previously, only jpeg files were downloaded). He also improved [logging errors](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsocialcache/pull/2).

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [optimized the calculation of the Wifi weak RSSI list](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/67), to happen only once. The repository has also been [updated to upstream version 1.33](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/66).

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **pvuorela** created a singleton `ConnMan` object to [expose paths](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/32) and avoid the creation of full technology objects.

* `buteo-syncfw`, the framework handling synchronisation, **sunweaver** contributed [conditional compilation in the synchroniser](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/16), to allow to use Buteo Synchronisation framework in OS without Nemo keepalive, like Ubuntu touch. **pvuorela** cleaned up the packaging [not to include private headers](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/17).

## User interface

* `yamui`, a minimal UI tool for displaying simple graphical indicators, **spiiroin** added [support for a centred text](https://github.com/sailfishos/yamui/pull/15) in addition to an image in the minimal visual interface used during OS update for instance.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [fixed issues due to cached launcher items](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/54), for instance MIME type changes didn't take effect until Lipstick was restarted.

* **pvuorela** adjusted margins in some applications to take into account devices with large screen radius in the corners or cut-out areas:
 - in [`sailfish-office`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-office/pull/194),
 - in `sailfish-browser` for [rounded corners](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1061) and [cut-outs](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1060),
 - in [`fingerterm`](https://github.com/sailfishos/fingerterm/pull/7).
 
* `sailfish-components-filemanager`, QML components to create a file manager, **pvuorela** added [error reporting](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager/pull/8) in console during disk usage calculation.

## Low level libraries

* `firejail`, the isolation mechanism for process from the host system, **dcaliste** fixed an issue with [the time zone for jailed applications](https://github.com/sailfishos/firejail/pull/19). Prior to the fix, any change of the device time zone was not propagated inside the isolated applications.

* `qtsensors`, Qt bindings for the sensor framework, **spiiroin** fixed an issue, making [the UI not to react to orientation changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtsensors/pull/2).

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** ensured [proper retry and clean exit](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/26) when loading the Hybris sensor module.

* `sensors-glib`, sensors API for glib based C applications, **spiiroin** created a [new interface to sensors](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensors-glib/pull/1), using a C API based on GLib objects.

## Developer's corner

* `busybox`, a single binary which includes versions of a large number of system commands, **mal** [increased the maximum line length](https://github.com/sailfishos/busybox/pull/9) when editing.

* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS/phone history, **pvuorela** [avoided packaging the private headers](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/12).

* `transfer-engine`, the backend to allow sharing data between apps, **pvuorela** added [a new API to declare available methods for a plugin](https://github.com/sailfishos/transfer-engine/pull/18).
