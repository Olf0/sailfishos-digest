# Repository roundup

This last two weeks has mostly been a period of stabilisation with some interesting bug fixes like the one patching `firejail` race condition on application launch, making starting time sometimes longer than necessary, or a cache issue in `lipstick`, making it not aware of MIME type changes.

## Communication bits

* `connman`, the connection manager, **Laakkonenjussi** proposed to [upgrade it to 1.33](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/66).

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **pvuorela** [deprecated the `status` property](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/29) in `NetworkManager` class (which was a string) and replaced it with a new property called `globalStatus` based on an enumeration. He removed also some unnecessary warnings, see [this](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/30) and [that](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/31) pull requests.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity`, QML bindings for network connectivity, **pvuorela** [propagated the new API](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity/pull/11) using `NetworkManager::globalStatus`.

* `connectionagent`, a daemon and QML bindings to connect to ConnMan, **pvuorela** also [used the new API here](https://github.com/sailfishos/connectionagent/pull/6).

## Navigating the web

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **pvuorela** [corrected the packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/167) by not installing the private logging header.

## User interface

* `nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager`, QML components to create a file manager, **pvuorela** [added warnings](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-filemanager/pull/8) on `DiskUsage` callbacks error results.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [fixed issues due to cached launcher items](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/54), for instance MIME type changes didn't take effect until Lipstick was restarted.

## Low level libraries

* `usb-moded`, the USB tracking daemon, **spiiroin** [fixed a crash](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/17) due to out-of-bounds access when reading `/proc/cmdline`.

* `libusb-moded-qt`, a library of Qt bindings for usb_moded, **pvuorela** [updated the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/libusb-moded-qt/pull/3) to use logging capabilities from Qt and the Qt5 `connect()` syntax.

* `firejail`, the isolation mechanism for process from the host system, **spiiroin** [fixed an issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/firejail/pull/18) that resulted in long startup times of jailed applications.

* `busybox`, a single binary which includes versions of a large number of system commands, **vigejolla** took a patch from upstream, [fixing line break issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/busybox/pull/8).

* `libnfcdef`, a library for parsing and building NFC Data Exchange Format messages, [the repository](https://github.com/sailfishos/libnfcdef) was added in Sailfish OS and initialised with the code from **monich**.

* `libpsl`, a collection of Top Level Domains suffixes, **pvuorela** [updated it to 0.21.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/libpsl/pull/2).

## Developer's corner

* **pvuorela** cleaned the packaging of various repositories, moving for instance the `.so` file to the `-devel` package:
 - in [`nemo-qml-plugin-contacts`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-contacts/pull/11),
 - in [`nemo-qml-plugin-models`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-models/pull/7),
 - in [`libcommhistory`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/11)
 - in [`vault`](https://github.com/sailfishos/vault/pull/2).
 
* `sailfish-browser`, the browser itself, **pvuorela** properly declared the QML files, so [they now show up in Qt Creator](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1059).

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **Thaodan** [corrected some build issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/22) related to Lua.

* **martyone** and **monich** updated the packaging in various repositories to use the `make_build` macro:
 - in [`binder-utils`](https://github.com/sailfishos/binder-utils/pull/6),
 - in [`mlite`](https://github.com/sailfishos/mlite/pull/7),
 - in [`nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/17),
 - in [`nemo-qml-plugin-notification`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-notifications/pull/14),
 - in [`transfer-engine`](https://github.com/sailfishos/transfer-engine/pull/17),
 - in [`nemo-keepalive`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-keepalive/pull/7),
 - in [`libglibutil`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libglibutil/pull/15).

* `sailfish-secrets`, a framework to use encryption techniques, **pvuorela** [fixed issues when building with newer compilers](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets/pull/192), reporting about implicitly declared copy-contstructors. **Thaodan** proposed a patch to update to [use newer OpenSSL 3 API](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets/pull/191).
