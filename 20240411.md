# Repository roundup

Most of the changes reported in the last two weeks are changes done in the main branches of each repositories. The functionalities for coming version 4.6 has been freezed already and only fixes are done for that version in branches named `upgrade-4.6`.

## Communication bits

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** [fixed an issue introduced in function `deleteAllIncidences()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/66) making WebCAL synchronisers duplicate events on sync. He later on [removed this function completely](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/67) to decrease the API differences with upstream `KCalendarCore::Calendar` class. Indeed, this function became after the fix a simple wrapper on a two line loop.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-webcal`, a sync plugin to sync web calendar resources, **dcaliste** [replaced a call to the removed `deleteAllIncidences()` function from `mKCal`](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-webcal/pull/5).

* `openconnect`, open client for Cisco AnyConnect VPN, **pvuorela** [excluded two Python files from packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/openconnect/pull/3) to avoid a dependency on `Python3` that is not needed.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **dcaliste** [reworked the attachment model](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/20) so it is linked to an EmailMessage object. It should allow to deal with attachments in encrypted emails.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **pvuorela** performed [various clean-up on the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/28). He also proposed to [deprecate the `status` property](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/29) in `NetworkManager` class (which was a string) and replace it with a new property called `globalStatus` based on an enumeration.

## Navigating the web

* `embedlite-components`, QML components for the browser, **ilpianista** proposed to [expose if a download result is coming from a tab in private mode](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/97).

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **pvuorela** changed the build system to [create a shared library for the browser and the captive portal application](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1056). It saves on build time, disk space and memory consumption. **ilpianista** proposed [not to store in the transfer list, files that have been doanloaded from a private tab](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1057).

## User interface

* `mce`, mode control entity, **mal** [exposed the `battery_charging_enabled` entry from the kernel](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/26), to allow to pull power for the device from an USB link without charging the battery.

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **mal** added [support for Android sensor device API 1.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/25).

## Multimedia

## Low level libraries

* `openssl`, utilities and library for cryptography, **Thaodan** worked on [updating legacy OpenSSL 1.1 version to its latest patch](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssl1.1/pull/1).

* `libarchive`, a library to handle compressed formats, **mal** [updated it to 3.7.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/libarchive/pull/4).

* `util-linux`, a collection of basic system utilities, **mal** [disabled CD-ROM probing](https://github.com/sailfishos/util-linux/pull/8) since it creates a kernel crash on some Unisoc devices due to ioctl number collision with ufs_sprd driver ioctls.

## Developer's corner

* `python3-requests`, Python module to execute HTTP requests, **nephros** [updated it to 2.31.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-requests/pull/4).

* `rpm`, a software package format and tools, **Thaodan** picked a patch from Open Suse that [doesn't check for unpackaged info pages](https://github.com/sailfishos/rpm/pull/16). So there is no need anymore to remove info pages in the installation steps in RPM spec files.
