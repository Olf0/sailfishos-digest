# Repository roundup


## The network stack

* `tayga`, an out-of-kernel stateless NAT64 implementation for Linux, **LaakkonenJussi** is [removing EAM patches](https://github.com/sailfishos/tayga/pull/2) since they are breaking the initial CLAT implementation. It may be reverted later though according to the commit message. EAM stands for Explicit Address Mapping and is defined in RFC7757. It extends the `map <ipv4> <ipv6>` into `map <ipv4 subnet> <ipv6 subnet>`.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** finished the [main pull request on CLAT support](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/39) and it got merged. It's also part of a `upgrade-4.5.0` branch, and has been published already as a hot-fix to the 4.5.0 release.

## Sound stack

* `amber-mpris`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **pvuorela** [hided the `MprisClient` object](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/22) since it's an internal implementation detail that should not be exposed in QML. **flypig** and **tomin1** [added `canShuffle` and `canLoop` properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/20).

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** [removed the deprecated support of non standard timezone in the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/52). He also [cleanup the `ExtendedCalendar` and the `ExtendedStorage` API removing used methods](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/53). **pvuorela** fixed later on [an issue in the declaration of the `DummyStorage` class](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/54).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, **dcaliste** fixed a long standing issue [making the displayed date and times wrong in the calendar application on timezone change](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/47).

* `contactsd`, the daemon handling contacts, since a contact can now have an empty name, **pvuorela** implemented [fallbacks to display a sensible label for birthday calendar events](https://github.com/sailfishos/contactsd/pull/6).

## Synchronisation framework

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, the plugin used by the synchronisation framework to sync contacts via the CardDAV protocol, **pvuorela** [avoided to restart `msyncd` daemon on plugin installation](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/4), since the plugin is now an out-of-process executable called by the daemon.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **pvuorela** [fixed a missing dependency on `blts-tools`](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/17) to run the package tests on the test-farm and also [adjusted the test label](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/18). **pvuorela** [cleaned up the `.spec` file also to avoid `msyncd` restart on package installation](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/19).

* `buteo-sync-plugins`, various plugins including Bluetooth synchronisation, **pvuorela** updated the plugin to [use `systemsettings`](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins/pull/4) instead of the deprecated `QSystemInfo`.

## System control

* `timed`, time and alarm handling daemon, **dcaliste** [fixed a missing dependency in the development package](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/6) making `timed-devel` not pulling QtDBus and the associated package.

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** is proposing a fix for [deadlocking state on exit](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/7) due to pending interactions with `libgbinder`. **Igtrombetta** is proposing a fix on [values reported by magnetometer](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/8) coming from a patch developped on Ubuntu Touch on the Pine Phone.


## Low level libraries

* `openssl`, utilities and library for cryptography, **direc85** is proposing two commits [fixing issues reported by `rpmlint`](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssl/pull/5) when building the package.

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** got two commits merged in [allowing to request to just blanking the screen without automatically activate the lockscreen](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/23). From the log message, **spiiroin** is mentioning situations where the lockscreen is not desirable. Maybe, IVI (in vehicule infotainment) is the kind of situations where there is no lockscreenâ€¦

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, **dsuni** [removed the inclusion of `disable-passwdmgr.inc`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/138) from the base permissions since it is no longer used by `firejail` 0.9.72.

* `sdk-setup`, part of the Sailfish SDK, **Thaodan** got merged his pull request to [ensure that `mb2 apply` will work when there are tabs in the spec file](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/356).

* `sdk-test-suite`, the test suite for the SDK tools, **vigejolla** is using [specific commits to test `storeman` and `OSM scout`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-test-suite/pull/19). **Olf0** commented and discussed the validity of the change.
