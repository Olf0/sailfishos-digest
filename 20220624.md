# Repository roundup

A lot of repositories (several tens) has seen the creation of a new `upgrade-4.4.0` branch. This has often been used to backport fixes from the development branch to a given SailfishOS version, precluding (or not) a hot fix release like the 4.4.0.64 that happened a bit after 4.4.0.58 was out. These new branches didn't receive any backport commit yet, though, meaning that they may be used for something else than a hot fix release. Let's wait and see.

## Browser stack

* `embedlite-components-search-engines`, the QML components used by the browser for search engines, modifications proposed by **rainemak* [to comply with Google rules requesting consent when their search engine is used for the first time](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components-search-engines/pull/1) were accepted.
* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **rainemak** fixed an issue ending up with the [browser preferences not being able to store values](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/160) like proxy port, see this [forum question](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/browser-configuration-does-not-store-integer-values/1017) by **ugeuder**.

## Network stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi**'s work on a [better support for traffic routing changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/29), is still under active development.

## QML bindings

## Calendar stack

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste** is proposing a change in the importation logic to [allow to discard organiser](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/38) so the event is not seen as an external invitation and can be modified.

* `flex`, a free implementation of the lexical analyser `lex`, thaodan fixed a [typo in the `BuildRequires` of the packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/flex/pull/2).
