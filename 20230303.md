# Repository roundup

There is a new repository, mysteriously called [`sailfish-labs`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-labs) that appeared last week but is currently empty. One can try to guess what it could be used for. I'm starting the game, guessing that it may store some QML components, like the [Qt labs platform](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtlabsplatform-index.html) ? Besides, there were less visible pull requests this fortnight, but it's worth mentioning the huge work on IPv6 stack to allow access with IPv4 networks.

## The network stack

* `tayga`, an out-of-kernel stateless NAT64 implementation for Linux, this repository is newly imported into SailfishOS. **dsuni** created the [packaging for it](https://github.com/sailfishos/tayga/pull/1).

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** started working on [adding VPN support with CLAT](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/41). Wikipedia has a page [explaining the transition tools used for IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_transition_mechanism). The work also continues in the [main pull request on CLAT support](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/39).

## Sound stack

* `amber-mpris`, QML bindings for remote control of music players, **pvuorela** [hided the `MprisClient` object](https://github.com/sailfishos/amber-mpris/pull/22) since it's an internal implementation detail that should not be exposed in QML.

## Calendar stack

* `mkcal`, storage backend using SQLite for calendar entries, **dcaliste** changed the loading mechanism to [ensure that it's not possible to populate the memory representation of the database with orphaned exceptions or recurring incidences with missing exceptions](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/47). **pvuorela** quickly [patched also the mkcal tool](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/48) used for alarms to avoid the deprecation warning. **dcaliste** and **pvuorela** started a large code cleaning, suppressing unused methods inherited from the slit of KCal into KCalendarCore and mKCal. This work includes the [removal of specific load methods](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/50), the [removal of a journal specific routine](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/51) but is also proposing to [remove the deprecated support of non standard timezone in the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/52). Additionnaly, **dcaliste** submitted a patch to [add a search method through out the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/mkcal/pull/49).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML bindings for calendar events, **dcaliste** propagated some [changes on how incidence are loaded from their UID](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/44). **pvuorela** removed some [depecated usage of `KCalendarCore::IncidenceBase::setHasGeo()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/46). **dcaliste** started to work on [a new QML model to expose results of a search query in the database](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/45).

## Synchronisation framework

* `buteo-sync-plugins-social`, several sync plugins for Google, Facebook and other proprietary protocols, as for the CalDAV plugin, **dcaliste** propagated some [changes on how incidence are loaded from their UID](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/8).

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **pvuorela** removed some [depecated usage of `KCalendarCore::IncidenceBase::setHasGeo()`](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-calendar/pull/14). Then **dcaliste** completely [removed the tests of IncidenceHandler](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/15), since the purpose of their tests were not in use anymore in the synchronisation plugin. On **pvuorela**'s advice, **dcaliste** also added an XML file to [run the full tests automatically](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/16) on the test farm.

## System control

* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, the QML bindings for DBus, **attah** is proposing to [add support for array of strings](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/13). This could be used in his SeaPrint application in the share plugin so it may open the application with the right parameters.

## Low level libraries

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **gber** got his patch merged. It allows to [build with the autohybris config and its also addressing linking issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/5).

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** made it simpler to [reset values on command-line](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/22) by using the specific argument `/reset` with `--set-ffo=` parameter switch. **spiiroin** is proposing to add a [new command for display off that is only blanking the screen](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/23) without locking the device.

## SDK and developer tools

* `sdk-build-tools`, a package of scripts used to build the Sailfish SDK, **martyone** [added the documentation for Bluez module of KDE Framework](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-build-tools/pull/125). **vigejolla** [changed the subnet address of the build host to be `10.21.0.20`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-build-tools/pull/126) and not `10.0.0.20`. **vigejolla** is also [proposing to use LiteHTML as default viewer backend](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-build-tools/pull/127). He added a patch to [fix build on MacOS](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-build-tools/pull/128) because of a missing include.

* `sdk-setup`, part of the Sailfish SDK, **Thaodan** submitted a pull request to [ensure that `mb2 apply` will work when there are tabs in the spec file](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-setup/pull/356).

## Sailfish OS website

* **vigejolla** [updated the list harbour restriction list](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/272) for 4.5.0.

* **martyone** [removed the notice telling that a snapshot is used](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/130) in the Platform SDK. Since snapshots are hidden by default, he also [removed them from the listing examples](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/131).

* **The-Unsticker** proposed to changed the initial phrasing about the SDK to [emphase that it is running in a virtual machine](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/269). **martyone** commented that the idea should be the opposite.

* **jovirkku** complemented the media application article with a section on [adding a playlist for Internet streaming](https://github.com/sailfishos/docs.sailfishos.org/pull/275).
