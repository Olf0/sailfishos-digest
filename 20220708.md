# Repository roundup

A lot of repositories (several tens) have seen the creation of a new `upgrade-4.4.0` branch. This has often been used to backport fixes from the development branch to a given Sailfish OS version, precluding (or not) a hot fix release like the 4.4.0.64 that happened a bit after 4.4.0.58 was out. These new branches haven't received any backport commits yet, though, meaning that they may be used for something else than a hot fix release. Let's wait and see.

## Multimedia

* `ffmpeg`, a framework to encode and decode multimedia resources, following a forum question and a discussion during a community meeting, **abranson** enabled the compilation for [support of ALAC codec](https://github.com/sailfishos/ffmpeg/pull/2).

## Packaging

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **abranson**'s pull request [to ensure that user-added repositories will not override system ones](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/10) has been merged in.

## Telephony stack

* `ofono`, the telephony framework, **Flohack74** is proposing a patch to [raise the current hard-coded limit of 999 cell broadcast channels](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/35). Channels with higher numbers can actually be in use, like 4384 for emergency alerts in Taiwan for instance.
* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS/phone history, **thaodan** partially [reverted a previous change to restore old notification categories](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/8) still used by some applications.

## Audio stack

* `ohm-plugins-misc`, some plugins inherited from Nokia for the open hardware manager (OHM), **jusa** [fixed an issue with initial audio routing being undefined](https://github.com/sailfishos/ohm-plugins-misc/pull/5) before a route is set.

## QML bindings

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **herrie82** [upgraded the source code base to be able to compile with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/9) and the patch was merged.
* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, QML bindings for DBus, **pvuorela** is proposing an alternative to the pull request initiated by **herrie82** which [adapts the code for more recent versions of Qt](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/9).

## Calendar stack

* `nemo-qml-plugin-calendar`, the QML for calendar access, **dcaliste**'s proposed change in the importation logic to [allow organisers to be discarded](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-calendar/pull/38) has been accepted. With the patch, imported event can drop attendees.

Notice that PWAs are only fully supported by Chromium at the moment with partial support for Firefox on Android but not on desktop.

## Software engineering

* `libgrilio`, a GLib-based library to interface with RIL, **slava** fixed a [parallel build issue caused by incorrect dependencies in the `Makefile`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libgrilio/pull/3).

Post scriptum : Summer (currently in the northern hemisphere) is often the period for vacations and I'll be off for some time. I'll still be looking at GitHub news and forum discussions from time to time but I'll not be able to write these digests. If anyone would like to replace me for a while, please feel free to do it and contact @flypig to add it to the community letter. Otherwise, you should be able to read the next repo digest on 25th August. Enjoy the summer!
