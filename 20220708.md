# Repository roundup

A lot of repositories (several tens) has seen the creation of a new `upgrade-4.4.0` branch. This has often been used to backport fixes from the development branch to a given SailfishOS version, precluding (or not) a hot fix release like the 4.4.0.64 that happened a bit after 4.4.0.58 was out. These new branches didn't receive any backport commit yet, though, meaning that they may be used for something else than a hot fix release. Let's wait and see.
