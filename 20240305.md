# Repository roundup

Thanks to the hard work of **mal** on the GCC upgrade, some blockers with `systemd` have been addressed and the patches merged some days ago.

## Communication bits

* `nemo-qml-plugin-social`, social QML adapters for Nemo, **Karry** is working on [giving read-only access to the shared calendars](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugins-social/pull/11) with Google.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, a plugin for synchronising contacts, **jmlich** pull request to [support Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/5) was merged by **pvuorela**.

* `mobile-broadband-provider-info`, the database of access point configurations,**ruditimmermans** [corrected the MNC and the APN for Mobile Vikings](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/21) in Belgium. **pvuorela** [cleaned the spec file](https://github.com/sailfishos/mobile-broadband-provider-info/pull/22) used to build the package.

* `ofono`, the telephony library, **mal** backported [two fixes for CVE-2023-4233 and CVE-2023-4234](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/42). **pvuorela** switched back [`mobile-broadband-provider-info` as a requirement](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/44) for `ofono`.

* `libqofonoext`, Qt bindings for specific Sailfish OS extension to Ofono, **pvuorela** proposed to [convert the NCI property into a string](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofonoext/pull/6). The current declaration as an enum with 64 bits values is not ideal since not working in QML. NCI is the id of the cell used in a 5G network.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** picked several upstream fixes dealing with routing : [append the correct attribute type for RTA_DST](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/56) or [support for subnet routes](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/57).  **LaakkonenJussi** also [added support for `--data-cyphers` option](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/59) with OpenVPN.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** introduced a [default route update](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/25) only when there are some changes in the service cache. **iceaway** [implemented the `MoveBefore` / `MoveAfter` methods](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/24).

* `openvpn`, a VPN solution, **mal** [updated it to 2.6.9](https://github.com/sailfishos/openvpn/pull/5).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to handle system parameters, **LaakkonenJussi** added [support for `--data-cyphers` option](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/36) for OpenVPN. **pvuorela** [hide the implementation of the public classes](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/37), so dependencies on external libraries (except `libconnman-qt5`) are not exposed in the header files.

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** [merged latest upstream](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/15), bringing a different naming convention to avoid name clashing when saving attachments.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **dcaliste** [simplified a bit the email creation code](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/17), removing duplications with elements already implemented in `messagingframework`.

## Other applications

* `sailfish-office`, the document application, **dcaliste** introduce the possibility to [store passwords for read-protected PDF documents](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-office/pull/193).

## Low level libraries

* `libsocialcache`, a library and a QML plugin that is used to manage cache from social networks, **jmlich** [upgraded it for Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsocialcache/pull/1).

* `giflib`, a library to manipulate GIF format image files, **mal** updated it to 5.2.2 and added a patch to [fix CVE-2021-40633](https://github.com/sailfishos/giflib/pull/3).

* `maliit-framework`, the code handling the keyboard, **MrCyjaneK** while working on Flutter integration, [enabled `glib2` support](https://github.com/sailfishos/maliit-framework/pull/5) as a separated package, named `maliit-framework-wayland-glib`.

* `usb-moded`, the USB tracking daemon, **spiiroin** [enabled by default the power supply type detection](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/16) based on the usual `power_supply` device. This is usefull for USB Power Devices (PD) that may not report being different from a computer.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [removed usage of too old `egrep`](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/50) in favour of `grep -E`.

* `quota`, tools to limit disk usage, **LaakkonenJussi** [ensured that `quota` run is finished](https://github.com/sailfishos/quota/pull/2) before launching elements that requires write access to the home directory. Indeed, `quota` is making the home filesystem read-only during its operation.

* `systemd`, a system and service manager, **mal** investigated an issue with `systemd` when compiled with a newer version of GCC. He [developped and backported various patches to fix the issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/systemd/pull/16).

## Developper's corner

* `vulkan-loader`, a graphic library to load Vulkan runtime, **mal** proposed to [update it to 1.3.277](https://github.com/sailfishos/vulkan-loader/pull/2) and also for the [compilation headers](https://github.com/sailfishos/vulkan-headers/pull/2).

* `glib2`, the Glib library from GTK / Gnome, **mal** merged his [upgrade to 2.78.4](https://github.com/sailfishos/glib2/pull/3).

* `glib-networking`, network extensions for GLib, **attah** [updated it to 2.78.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/glib-networking/pull/2).

* `libdbusaccess`, providing more fine-grained D-Bus access control, **mal** [fixed a unit test](https://github.com/sailfishos/libdbusaccess/pull/3) failing after the `glib2` upgrade.

* `android-tools-hadk`, the Android tools for the hardware development kit, **thaodan** proposed a commit [ensuring that all mount points are unmounted upon exit](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools-hadk/pull/9).

* `python-M2crypto`, Python module for using OpenSSL, **thaodan** proposed to [update it to 0.41.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-M2Crypto/pull/1).

* `pkcs11-helpers`, a library for using PKCS#11 providers, **mal** [updated it to 1.30.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/pkcs11-helper/pull/1).

* `libsailfishapp`,  , **dcaliste** [added a missing dependency on `qt5-qttools-linguist`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsailfishapp/pull/47), so translated applications using `libsailfishapp` can properly be built on OBS for instance where the linguist tools are not automatically installed.

* `binutils`, command line tools, **mal** [updated it to 2.42](https://github.com/sailfishos/binutils/pull/6).

* `perl-TimeDate`, a Perl module for time and date manipulation , **mal** [updated it to 2.33](https://github.com/sailfishos/perl-TimeDate/pull/1).
